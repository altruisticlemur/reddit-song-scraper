Telephone Line - Electric Light Orchestra
Debussy’s Claire de Lune.
I believe "Something" written by George Harrison is the most perfect love song ever written.

Imagine my surprise during the "Get Back" film when he brings an early version to John that goes "There's something in the way she moves, attracts me like a cauliflower"
Hoppípolla by Sigur Rós, Your Hand in Mine by Explosions in the Sky
This Must Be The Place- The Talking Heads

I don't know if it's technically "beautiful", but something about this song just gets me, right in my heart. It just feels like how I want love to feel.
End of the World - Skeeter Davis

Also,  Dolly Partons - I will love you.  I find it more emotional than Whitney’s version, though I do enjoy Whitney’s from time to time. 

I’m not really a country fan but these two songs are honestly so beautiful.
Chopins Nocturne in E flat Major (op 9 no 2)
The Blowers Daughter, Damien Rice.

God, I haven't thought about it in years either
Too many but "Time in a Bottle" by Jim Croce is very high up there for me as well as "Ave Maria" performed by Barbara Bonney.
I really love "DON'T DREAM ITS OVER" by Neil Finn / Crowded House. His other band Split ENZ and the song "Message To My Girl". Those songs captivated me when I first heard them. I mean, early Kate Bush too. Some of those songs of hers like The Man With The Child In His Eyes and Symphony In Blue... I could go on...
A Case of You by Joni Mitchell might be it for me. But it has a lot of associations for me personally. Her entire album Blue really. Just magic. Harvest Moon by Neil Young would also be in the running for me.
Holocene - Bon Iver
Harvest Moon by Neil Young

That or maybe some Bach cello tunes.

Songbird - Christine McVie w/Fleetwood Mac

Enjoy the silence by Depeche Mode
Father and Son by Cat Stevens
Between the Bars by Elliot Smith. 
I find it haunting yet beautiful.
Landslide by Fleetwood Mac
Morning Has Broken, Cat Stevens.
“Silence” by Delirium, featuring Sarah McLachlan (make sure you get the unabridged 6:34 version and not the radio cut; it absolutely destroys its flow and harmony).

When I was 19, a friend of mine had just graduated boot camp. He came home and met both his best friend and I at his mom’s house and we headed out shortly after. But before we did, he sat in front of his sound system and just listened with his eyes closed to Orbital’s “Halcyon and On and On” (another excellent choice in this vein). I didn’t understand why then. Once I myself graduated boot camp, this song became for me what that song was to him—a reset of my soul from a hardening trauma that you can’t explain, you can only feel.

This song healed my soul. I hope you find the song that does for yourself.

The Trapeze Swinger - Iron & Wine

Maybe a little gauche seeing some of the responses here, but :Nightswimming by REM - especially the live version of just Stipe + Mikey Mills on piano..

It gets me every time  


Edit for the vid:   
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVT0S0j7F9Y&list=RDKVT0S0j7F9Y&start\_radio=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVT0S0j7F9Y&list=RDKVT0S0j7F9Y&start_radio=1)  


For any fellow musicians out there, just watch how these absolute pinnacles of performance interact with each other.. I think this is one of the most pure and beautiful moments of live music ever captured.  


Stipe and Mills in perfect sync, wrought through many years of working together.. Just that look at the end where it's a shared moment of ".... damn that was good.."

Gymnopedie no 1 Erik Satie
Saturn by Sleeping at Last. It shares how it’s rare and beautiful to even exist, and how the universe was made just to be seen by our eyes. I listen to it when I need inspiration or a mood boost. Highly recommend all songs by this artist!
Song for Zulu- phosphorescent
On My Own from Les Mis.  Heartbreakingly beautiful.

Maybe by Alison Krauss is a close second
Schindler's List Theme by John Williams
Pink Moon - Nick Drake
Different music grabs you at different times in your life and becomes beautiful for that moment. Twelve year old me and forty year old me have  different opinions...thats how its supposed to be.

The other day I heard **"Good ole boys like me" by Don Williams**..and I remembered hearing it as a kid in the back of my parents station wagon and it took me back....it made me think thats one of the most God damned beautifully haunting songs ever.
i love remember me from coco. its such a pretty song

"just Like Heaven"-The Cure
be quiet and drive (far away) by deftones

Sound & Vision David Bowie
Can’t Help Falling In Love by Elvis Presley
Sigur Rós - Ágætis Byrjun
O' Holy Night by a Danish choir called "BarbAros". Unfortunately you won't find it anywhere because it was given to me by a friend in the choir, so its in a special folder on my laptop. Not sure if I can share it others either, but there's been moments where I've been so sad, turn it on, and experience such catharsis by the end of the song means a lot to me. It has helped me in sooo many ways. I cannot thank my friend enough for this gift.
We’ve only just begun. The Carpenters.

Edit: my husband says the song Jessie sings in toy story 2 when they put her in the box
10,000 Days by Tool - especially if you know the background of the song
Wuthering Heights - Kate Bush
I can’t make you love me- Bon Iver version
Nessun Dorma, the Luciano Pavarotti version.

There's this crescendo in the song that just takes my breath away every time and brings tears to my eyes.  I don't even need to understand the words to feel the passion in that man's voice.
Into the West, Annie Lennox, especially given the context of the song at the conclusion of one of the best stories ever told
Ahead by a Century, The Tragically Hip.
The Dance-Garth Brooks 
The one and only time I danced with my dad. About 13 or so. Just lost him Dec of last year. 40 now and I wish I could go back

I genuinely apologise in advance for your heartstrings and tear ducts.
Radiohead - Motion Picture Soundtrack
Let it be - the beatles.  (Was used as the last song at a friend's mother's funeral)
Hard for me to pick between Samual Barber's Adagio For Strings, Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, Claude Debussy's Clair de Lune, Iz's cover of Somewhere Over the Rainbow, and Elvis' Can't Help Falling in Love. These songs just move me.
La Vie en Rose- Edith Piaf
Heard it a lot growing up in romantic scenes of movies and TV shows and as background in some games... but there was one contestant on the voice (Australia I think) named Rachael Leahcar who sang it for her audition, and it was the first time a song ever moved me to tears.

Aka the wedding entrance song.

Cliche, but it's what my wife walked down the aisle to.  I hadn't seen her yet that day, hadn't seen her in her dress.

Holy hell, her beauty just took my breath away as the piano and cello players played those beautiful and haunting notes.  It's been Going on 2 decades now and I still can close my eyes and hear every note, see her walking down that aisle.

Colorblind - Counting Crows

Simple... Evocative... Short... Haven't heard a new song do something like this in a long time.
“The Suburbs” by Arcade Fire. The transition from that to “Ready to Start” is still my favourite 2 song sequence in any album. The album for these two songs, “The Suburbs”, won the 2011 Grammy for Album of the Year and they were very unknown at the time so it was an underdog story.
The night we met - lord huron. Hauntingly beautiful and it’s feature in thirteen reasons why makes it all the more powerful

Fast Car - Tracy Chapman
My son singing to my daughter to help her stop crying
My husband sang “Even If” when our son was dying and everyone sobbed it was so beautiful. He doesn’t sing much anymore but that was special.

Otherwise— There, There Katie. I listened to it a lot when we knew things were bad with our son and my name is one letter off from Katie. It was like he was singing this pain filled song to heal my heart.

Chris Cornell’s version of “Patience” or his song “The Promise”
Bit of a weird one, but everyone please checkout “le grande amour” even if you dont speak french, i promise be worth your time
Wheat Kings by the Tragically Hip
A few of my favorites:

The prayer (Andrea boccelli and Celine dion have a great version, as do the Canadian tenors)

Sound of silence (Simon and Garfunkel is great, but disturbed will always be my favorite)

Flower duet (soprano opera duet)
Whatever that dude was playing on his banjo for the fox

Black by Pearl Jam. Don’t know honestly the most beautiful song I’ve ever heard because there are lots but this one I feel is beautiful, emotional, and reminds me of a particular time of my life. I could listen to it over and over and I don’t think I’d get tired of it.
3 Libras - A Perfect Circle
"In My Life" by the Beatles -- I weep every time. 

"You've Got a Friend" by James Taylor.  I was a lonely kid, and that sweet old man sings to my soul.
Whatever song Andy played in The Shawshank Redemption
"Crying" duet with Roy Orbison and kd lang
I love posts like this. I'm about to be introduced to beautiful music I haven't come across yet. Awesome
Hurt by Johnny Cash
Yesterday by Paul McCartney
Waltz 1 by Elliott Smith
[deleted]
Hunger Strike by Temple of the Dog.
Only In Dreams by Weezer.  It's one of those songs that makes you want to contact the songwriter (Rivers Cuomo in this case) and thank them for bringing it into existence.  I have rocked out to it, it has given me goosebumps, and it has made me cry.
November Rain. Despite what the music video might have you think, the orchestra sounds on the actual song were done entirely by Axl Rose using synthesizers, one layer at a time. Say what you want about that guy, but when he commits, he commits.
Purple Rain by Prince has gotta be high up there, especially when the solo kicks in.
Sullivan Street by Counting Crowes
Scarborough Fair- Celtic Woman
Blood by the middle east
River flows in you is the only instrumental song I’ve ever cried about
On the Nature of Daylight, by Max Richter
Dance with my father - Luther Vandrose

Your Eyes -- Peter Gabriel

He stopped loving her today - George Jones

Lucky Man - Emerson Lake and Palmer
River of Deceit  - Mad Season

If you want to hear someone pour their soul out about their addiction and suffering, this is it. The song is in a major key so it sounds like a happy song, but the lyrics are quite dark. The disparity between the too and the way they blend together is something I haven't heard in many other songs.

Most Alice in Chains/Layne Staley fans already know about it, but it is a must for any grunge fan.

Paradise Circus by Massive Attack
Just a song before I go  by  Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young
“Glass”- joy division, the chaotic beauty is just impossible to explain
Song For Zula by Phosphorescent 

I remember the exact moment I heard that song for the first time. I was at a bar with a friend. It was early evening. I could hear this gorgeous song playing. I was so intrigued I interrupted my own conversation to ask the bartender if they could tell me the song. Ever since that day, it’s been my morning alarm song. Every single day. 

That was back in 2014 if I’m not mistaken.
Winter by Tori Amos
Hide and Seek by Imogen Heap
Spiegel im Spiegel, composed by Arvo Pärt

No vocals, just piano and viola. And it never fails to just make me weep uncontrollably 

https://youtu.be/TJ6Mzvh3XCc
Angels by Robbie Williams. First heard it in the BBC version of Dracula (3 part mini series on Netflix, highly recommend!), and have been obsessed with that song ever since.
Hallelujah, while originally done by Leonard Cohen, I’ve always loved the version by Rufus Wainwright (yes from Shrek) and I’m really into the recent version by Nurko & Devon Baldwin.

The music video is super cute, it was apparently a casting call for couples and people in love, and they listened to this song for the first time, and they filmed their reaction to the song. It's just so damn beautiful.

Gymnopedies - Erik Satie

Stone in Focus - Aphex Twin

Aunt Suzie - Buckethead

A song for Milly Michaelson - Thrice
Little Wing - Jimi Hendrix and/or Stevie Ray Vaughn
Modern: Maxence Cyrin's piano cover of the Pixies' "Where Is My Mind"

Classical: Edvard Grieg, "Morning Mood" (from Peer Gynt, which also contains "In the Hall of the Mountain King," which is less *beautiful* than *frenetic and thunderous*).  I'm sure you've heard it somewhere, so maybe not an original answer, but it's widely used for a reason.

Bonus: "Coventry Carol" (15th century [IIRC] English Christmas carol). Don't bother with the Annie Lennox version, find a church choir.  It's haunting.
True Love Waits - Radiohead (the original bootleg version) 

Tied with Wish You Were Here - Pink Floyd
Misguided Angel - Cowboy Junkies
She's Leaving Home by The Beatles.
You can visualize the whole song. 
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy, our baby's gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?
Talking heads - this must be the place
Miserere Mei by Allegri.

So beautiful the Pope locked the music in the Vatican and nobody outside the Basilica was allowed to perform it, until it got pirated by a teenage Mozart.
A Change is Gonna Come - Sam Cooke
on the nature of daylight. 

someone posted a similar question about a year ago and i clicked through every single suggestion and pinned dozens of new music. it was amazing. 

when i heard this song, it immediately bought back memories of my grandmother. listening to this song and closing my eyes… i just saw flashbacks of every single memory i have of my grandmother and i cried and cried and cried. i just cried and cried and cried. i cried so hard. 

now when i hear this song, i cry. i think about her. i think about how fast life goes by. i think about all the good things i want to do. i think about the beauty in every situation i went through, am going through and will go through… it just made a powerful impact on how i see life.
https://youtu.be/2QV7Rus7j60
So the story goes; Jeff Buckley was performing at a tribute concert for his dad Tim. He chose to cover one of his dads tunes but totally made it his own. His dad (Tim Buckley) abandoned him and his mom and this tune was very emotional for him to play. At the end you can hear a guitar string break so he goes a cappella to finish up the song. I get goosebumps each time I listen.
[Colour My World](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cWkXmx-0phc) - Chicago 

[A Place in the Sun](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W8lVPMWLCBQ) - Stevie Wonder

Stairway to heaven
Year of the cat - Al Stewart
Whoever makes a playlist of everything posted here gets an updoot from me.
It’s all Coming Back to Me Now
Floods by Pantera is a good candidate, but the beauty of it doesn't really hit you until the last 45 seconds when the outro starts and you get this sort of "darkness, death, and transitions" feeling.

Video Games Lana Del Rey

(P.S.:  All of his music is very captivating.)
The Shooting Star - Gojira

Tribute - Halo 3 Soundtrack (or any piece of Halo music, really)
Mozart's Lacrimosa has been stuck in my head for a couple days now, I find it is just an amazing song.

“If We Were Vampires” - Jason Isbell
“Our Fathers War” - Josh Ritter
“You Have Stolen My Heart” - Brian Fallon
“In the Wind” - Lord Huron
Jupiter. The classical music song
The letter duet from the marriage of Figaro aka canzonetta sull‘aria. 

„To this day I have no idea, what those two italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don‘t want to know. Some things are best left unsaid. I would like to think they were singing about something that was so beautiful, it can‘t be expressed in words and makes your heart ache because of it. I tell you those voices soared higher and farther than anybody in this gray place dared to dream. It was like some beautiful bird had flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away. For the briefest moment every last man at Shawshank felt free.“
Nutshell by Alice In Chains
Vienna by Billy Joel
I’m not too sure if this counts, but the poem [“In Flanders Field”](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NkKEynoTwp8) that pays tribute for the soldiers that fought in WW1, gives me chills.

M83 - Midnight City

November rain
Let it be
Grateful Dead - Attics of My Life
Sittin on the dock of the bay - Otis Redding

Gives me goosebumps when I hear him whistle at the end of the song knowing that would be the last thing he ever recorded. It was only added into the song because he couldn’t think of any other lyrics and he planned on adding lyrics to the next song the very next day but sadly he was he in a plane crash. He was only 26 with so much soul, we missed out on his talents.
Purple Rain - Prince.
The interlude of To Live Is to Die by Metallica is probably the most beautiful piece of music I’ve ever heard.

For context, the song is a tribute to their bass player who died a couple of years prior.

Edit: For someone who doesn’t listen to metal, though, the other parts of the song may be a little grating, especially given the notoriously bad production of the album that it’s on (us Metallica fans love it though). The interlude starts at 4:29 in the song if you want to jump straight to it.
[Hooverphonic - Mad About You (Live at Koningin Elisabethzaal 2012)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EA-MIYY1bg). But only this version of the song. Noémie Wolfs voice, attitude, and dress, and the way she sings into the microphone, the atmosphere from the orchestra playing, make this one of the most beautiful and damned sexy songs ever.


The most romantic song, the one that made me "feel" was [Macklemore & Ryan Lewis - Same Love - at the 2014 Grammies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km56wgILqnc).
The Fool On The Hill - The Beatles
Blowers daughter- Damien Rice.

•Wait - M83

•Tempelhof - Yann Tiersen

•Too many songs by Novo Amor to choose from
I fall in love too easily

Chet Baker
Vide Cor Meum. I find it hauntingly beautiful, which is crazy considering the source it was written for.
Old Friends by Simon & Garfunkel
Marry me Archie flyte
A Case of You by Joni Mitchell
To Sir With Love  :)
Every Breaking Wave by U2 used to make me sob, dunno why, I was very young when I first heard it. 

Running Up That Hill by Kate Bush. Tugs at my heart strings.

First Day Of My Life by Bright Eyes. Just pain.
1950 - King Princess
Worthy is the Lamb by London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. Literal chills at the harmonies and layers and bass. Unearthly and fitting.
A sad one but “everything means nothing to me” by Elliott Smith. Arguable, lots of his songs are hauntingly beautiful.
KD Lang sang Hallelujah for the Canadian Olympics...
The first half of Mykonos by Fleet Foxes
The Ice Dance at the end of Edward Scissorhands
Aqueous Transmission - Incubus
The Beatles- In My Life
I like to make lists because I can't seem to ever pick just one, so here goes:

"13 Angels Standing Guard 'Round The Side Of Your Bed" by Silver Mt Zion. Its absolutely haunting. 

"Caoineadh Cu Chulainn" , which I believe is an Irish folk song.

"Norupo" by Heliung

"A World of Madness" from the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack.

"La Vie en Rose" by Louis Armstrong, though that seems to be a common one, but I had to add it.

"Omen" by Guilhem Desq, or at least the first part, the second part devolves into a Hurdy Gurdy metal jam session, its Epic and worth a listen, but not exactly beautiful in the conventional sense.

"Clair De Lune" by Claude Debussy, again, a common pick here but I had to add it.

"The Epic of Gilgamesh", specifically the Peter Pringle cover.

"The Northerner Diaries" by Jeremy Soule, as in the whole album, please listen to it you won't regret it.

"Unsung War" from the Ace Combat 5 soundtrack

"Halo" from the Halo combat evolved soundtrack, no not the Beyonce one.

There is a song from the game *Sea of Thieves* called "Becalmed", and its a weirdly beautiful song that brought me to tears when I first heard it.
Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 in G major Prelude


Hands down the most beautiful piece of music I have ever heard; and maybe even the mot beautiful a human has ever crafted. 

Mischa Maisky's rendition almost reminds me of soul music with how much depth and emotion he plays it with. Every inch of his body goes into each stroke of the bow. Its breathtaking.

https://youtu.be/3vQ_8KAkfL4

This is the best performance of it he ever gave in my opinion.
Cowboy Junkies - I’m so lonesome I could cry
Marvin Gaye Whats Goin on
Orbital Halcyon +on +on
Bad, U2
Less famous but,

 "We are One" from the Lion king 2 really gets me. 

and "He lives in you" as well.  (esp with all the death this year going around, that one really gets me right in the heart strings).
What About Me - Missing Persons


Gets me every. Damn. Time.


Honorable mention to The Boys Of Summer by Don Henley and Only The Young by Journey.
Leonard Cohen- Hallelujah
Only Time - Enya
MacArthur Park by Richard Harris
Wild Flowers - Tom Petty
A Moment Apart - Odesza
La Llorna by Angela Aguilar. It’s haunting and beautiful. It’s sung in Spanish, I don’t speak Spanish, and it’s still the most beautiful song I’ve ever heard.
La Vie En Rose by Edith Piaf
Don't follow by Alice In Chains
I think Caribbean Blue by Enya is quite beautiful, every time I listen I’m taken to another world
Reckoner - Radiohead
God Only Knows - The Beach Boys
Hallelujah  
\- Leonard Cohen
Enigma : Return to innocence
Gymnopedie no. 1  Erik Satie  It's famous enough that most people think recognize it but obscure enough no one knows it's name.  Like an old friend from middle school whom you loved but can't remember their name when recalling a beautiful memory you shared together.
Going to say this as a tribute! Also it’s because it’s true.  It’s considered a rock opera. Meatloaf “I will do anything for love (but I won’t do that)” RIP Meatloaf! For your listening pleasure https://youtu.be/_cnPZSM85j8
There are so many, there's so way I can limit it to just one, but these are the ones currently top of mind

* Roberta Flack - The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face

* Al Green - How Can You Mend A Broken Heart

* Louis Armstrong - What a Wonderful World

* Johann Sebastian Bach - Concerto in D Minor
 (Vikingur Olafsson)

* Barber - Adiago for Strings Op11a

* Satie, Entremont - Gymnopedie No.1

* Joni Mitchell - Both Sides Now

* Phosphorescent - Song for Zula 

* Max Jury - Great American Novel

* Nahko and the Medicine - Love Letters to God

I could keep going for days and weeks. There's so much beautiful music out there, in different genres and languages and across the ages. I could add more in French, Spanish, and Arabic if people are interested. But I'll stop for now. I can't wait for this playlist you're going to create OP!!
What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong
Annie's song.
Rainbow by Kacey Musgraves

Dondante by My Morning Jacket

Time by Pink Floyd
Portishead's Glorybox comes to mind
At Last - Etta James
The wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald - Gordon Lightfoot. is hauntingly beautiful
“Time to Say Goodbye”, Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman.

I’m not much of an opera person, but this song has some monster FEELS
In dreams Roy Orbison
I know I’m late and this will be buried, but I scrolled and scrolled and couldn’t find it. Dust in the Wind by Kansas. It’s a haunting wail into the emptiness of our existence, a pointless dread that makes you want to simply live like it’s your last day. At least, that’s how it makes me feel. And yet, as despairing as it seems, I find myself coming back to it for hope, like it’s a necessary reminder for a fulfilling life
How To Disappear Completely by Radiohead
I think Brian Wilson’s vocals on “Don’t Worry Baby” are the most gorgeous I’ve heard in pop music. Break my heart every time.
The entire score to Interstellar by Hans Zimmer. Especially Cornfield Chase and Mountains. Hans Zimmer is a goddamn genius.
Total Eclipse of the Heart.
Dig-Mudvayne
Ave Maria.
Minerva by Deftones
Konstantine by Something Corporate
Bill Withers “Lovely Day”
Some good old blackhole sun
Don’t let me down- the Beatles

Love Reign O’er Me- The Who Quadrophenia
Nothing Else Matters by Metallica is an amazing song!
Might be cliché but….My Heart Will Go On
Kiss me-Sixpence None the Richer
Wings for Marie (parts 1 and 2) - Tool

Powerful and beautiful tribute to Maynard’s mother.   It has definitely made me tear up a number of times.
Ekki Mùkk, by Sigur Ros 

It’s like music from another planet
Seventeen by Janice Ian
Safe and Sound by Capital Cities
Sextape by Deftones
YYZ - Rush
Better man -pearl jam
“Somewhere Only We Know” by Keane has to be on this list somewhere.

So Long, Lonesome by Explosions in the Sky
Golden slumbers by the Beatles - but, and I might get crucified here, I prefer Jennifer Hudson’s version.
*Spem in Alium* (The Forty Voice Motet) by Thomas Tallis.

It's an English renaissance vocal piece  that if I ever hear performed live might make me melt into a blissful puddle. Even if you've never listened to anything resembling renaissance music, I highly recommend you put on a quality pair of headphones and listen to the recording by the Ora Singers.
ripple- grateful dead
On the Nature of Daylight
Say it ain't so by Weezer is one of the ones that always gets me. But I tend to change the station to avoid The Day the Music Died... That song haunts me

“What a wonderful world” by Louis Armstrong

No it's not a Rick roll, it's Pink Floyd "Wot's...Uh The Deal

This Woman's Work - Kate Bush

https://youtu.be/_NRdA0ST4Zg

I wish I could choose just one.
Cortez the Killer

All too well- T.S
Rainbow Connection - Kermit the Frog

Hesitating Beauty by Billy Bragg isn’t the smooth conventional beauty, but it is beautiful
"to build a home" by the cinematic orchestra
"Since I've been Loving You" by Led Zeppelin.
Arvo Pärt's Spiegel im Spiegel. It was played on the last episode of The Good Place, and it will forever be one of the most comforting songs I've ever heard. It's just so peaceful. And reading the YouTube comments on the song are an amazing look into how the song has helped people during difficult times. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ6Mzvh3XCc&ab_channel=playingmusiconmars

While not my absolute favorite, Rain, by Breaking Benjamin
I listened to it a lot during a rough time, and it reminds me of my fiancée. She's really helped me through so much. I absolutely adore her to pieces, and I plan on singing it to her at our wedding this year 
I tear up every time I practice it, thinking of singing it to her :')
It's a toss up between The flower duet from Lakmé, by Delibes or Duettino Sull'aria from The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart.
Clair de lune - Debussy
Nina Simone - Ne Me Quitte Pas

The title translates to Don't Leave Me.  I don't speak French but she sings it with such feeling and sadness.  One of my favorite songs of hers or by anyone else.

She just passed away in November and now I just think of that song often, sometimes listen and always cry a little.
Annie Lennox - Into the West
Wish you were here by Pink Floyd is up there for me. I cry errytime.

Just Breathe by Pearl Jam
Disturbed's cover of The Sound of Silence
"Eleanor Rigby" by The Beatles

has one of the most beautiful arrangements of strings I have ever heard. Worth all the listens in the world. 

Peace and Love
Runaway by Kanye
The Cure - ["Friday I'm In Love"](https://youtu.be/mGgMZpGYiy8)
 Clocks by Coldplay

The aria from Rusalka. Or Dylan’s “You’re a Big Girl Now”.
Modern: Bloodstream by Stateless

Classical music: Preludes in C-sharp minor - Rachmaninoff 
Mainly for nostalgia it hits me in the feels but “somebody that i use to know”-Gotye

The Freys How to Save a Life
"One", by U2.
Multiple contenders from me, although none of these are technically songs.

Sabaton A Lifetime of War
Return to me - Dean Martin ... thank me later
All Too Well (10 min version) by Taylor swift
DeVotchKa - How It Ends. It was in a gears of war trailer which just adds to the somber tone of the whole song

Probably most songs by Florence and the Machine, but most notable for me is The Dogs Days Are Over

The Epilogue in Les Miserables. Preferably the broadway production, not the movie. Fucking chills during the whole song, and then tears when they hit the line “to love another person is to see the face of God”
Simple Man by Leonard Skynyrd. A wonderful message and sentiment for every man. Sometimes we all need a reminder of what's really important in life
Incubus - Aqueous Transmission
Dance with my Father - Luther Vandross
Free Bird - Lynyrd Skynyrd
God Only Knows, Beach Boys

Might be basic but still a good one
Just a Friend by Biz Markie
Greensleeves or Ave maria

Also the gael
I don't know if it's the most beautiful but it's up there: *Time After Time* by Cyndi Lauper. That is some epic songwriting - the lyrics, the melody, the vocals, everything about it. I can't think of a better song that fully encapsulates breaking up, especially where love once hovered in the rooms and corridors we shared.
Just look up pink Floyd
La Station, by Jeanne Cherhal.
That's a french song, so if you don't speak french you may not enjoy it as much as I do.
It's about a woman explaining that when she was a child, her father always took her to the sewage treatment plant where he worked, cause he was passionate with it. So she became really passionate about it too, she loved going there ; now she loves the smell of sewers because it reminds her of her father.
[Love Really Hurts Without You by Billy Ocean](https://youtu.be/q5uMOOQ6MV0)
Blessed to be a Witness - Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals

Wish You Were Here - Pink Floyd

Yellow Ledbetter - Pearl Jam
Time by hans zimmer is up there
[This Damien Rice live recording.](https://youtu.be/mYPCYboEpmk) The passion on display is immense.
Saving all my love for you, cover by Lee Suhyun. It's something about her voice, so clear and simple yet so captivating. Even without the fancy riffs and belting I can feel her passion for music.
Peace Piece by Bill Evans
[“Peace Piece” by Bill Evans](https://youtu.be/Nv2GgV34qIg)
O children! By Nick Caves is up there for me.
Afterglow - Genesis

I get put in a transcendental state whenever I put it on. I'm particularly impartial to the live versions where it transitions in from the beauty that is Cinema Show.

Carpet Crawlers too. The encore they did on the reunion tour which I saw a few months back that had carpet crawlers was poignant and cathartic in the best way possible. Really felt like saying goodbye to an old friend. The friend might not walk or sound the same, but they're still them.
Le Cygne by Camille Saint-Saens   

It’s so sad yet so beautiful

I've heard a lot of buitiful music, but off the top of my head the song that I remember most when first hearing it is new years day by u2
Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds - One Sweet World from “Live at Luther College”
Glitter in the air by Pink, [the live version](https://youtu.be/b_Ct2mXZ0WM)
Either “Homeland” from “Spirit, Stallion of the Cimmaron” or the song that plays at the end of “The Fellowship of the Ring” when Frodo and Sam are in the boat. Both those movies have just absolutely beautiful scores.
Cats in the Cradle by Harry Chapin
I genuinely believe Cellophane by FKA Twigs in one of the most beautiful songs ever made. There are maybe a few more I can name but that’s always the first one that comes to mind.

edit: might i also add that while it is beautiful, you should not dismiss the pain that twigs is centering the song around
The Swan by Saint Saens. Makes me cry everytime.
Stop This Train - John Mayer
Grace, Jeff Buckley.
Call Yourself Renee by Okkervil River
Padam Padam by Edith Piaf will always be beautiful to me

Ripple - Grateful Dead

Makes me think of my mom, rest her soul.
Perth - Bon Iver

it reminds me of moments of emotional intensity, something strange for me because I am one of those who feels very little about many things
A lot of the songs I’d answer you with have been commented already but one that always comes to mind is Wind of Change by Scorpions
Miserere mei, Deus
3x5 by John Mayer. I think it describes the world well
Heavenly Father, by Bon Iver
maria callas- j'ai perdu mon eurydice
A thousand miles- Vanessa Carlton

Or Atleast this beautiful remake: https://youtu.be/tesr1OyymXo
[This specific acapella version](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vAoADCSpD-8) of “Heavenly Father” by Bon Iver.
Ocean Eyes - Billie Eilish
There's not just one but like 5 of the Nier: Automata sound track. Mmmmm.

Here's an obscure one: Days Go By, acoustic version, by Dirty Vegas.
Saturn by Sleeping At Last
Jonathan Rhys Meyers' cover of Moondance in August Rush
Hero of War by Rise Against
Lauren Aquilina - King

The story of love that once was but now isn't always gets to me
Operator by Jim Croce
Thunder Road - [The live piano version from the Hammersmith Ballroom, 1975.](https://youtu.be/6O3MO2y30fU)
So far away-Avenged Sevenfold. One of many tribute songs for their drummer who died too young. The emotion really shines on this one because it was part of the last album he worked on before dying so the sadness was immediate
Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds live at Radio City - #41
Bach Cello Suite No. 5 in C Minor
Bloodbank - Bon Iver

Love the feel of the entire song and the open to interpretation story being told.

THE HUSTLE - VAN MCCOY

Anathema - regret. It speaks to my soul.
Sleep by Slowdive.

Still heartbroken that it’s not on Spotify :(
Runaway by Aurora

Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen and sung by Jeff Buckley. I love it so much that I selected it for one of the songs played at my youngest brother’s funeral,
It's really tough but I think Schubert's Ständchen performe by Peter Schreier wins it for me. 

If I have to choose something modern i will go with "Komm, süßer Tod" from The End Of Evangelion. Having watching the show and the movie the song gains a new meaning that no song could have by itself.

"Pictures of You" by The Cure.
April Come She Will by Simon & Garfunkel

Probably Caledonia, by Dougie MacLean. It's a song about getting wistful about your homeland as you reach the end of your life. Beautiful song.

He wrote it while busking across Europe, in 10 minutes while on a beach in France. When he got back to the hostel he and some others were staying at, he played it for everyone. They were all so affected that they booked tickets back to Scotland the next day. I quite like the story.

Earth song - Michael Jackson
Yellow by Coldplay when I first heard it, it kind of gave a nostalgic feeling that I never had before. Something about that song just brings back really good memories
The Sound of Silence but the Disturbed version. Legit get goosebumps when I hear this. It's the only song that does that to me.
Fruit Salad-The Wiggles
Snuff by slipknot. (And before you say anything it’s not a scream song, it’s all clean vocals) Corey Taylor’s voice is so beautiful and utterly raw, you can hear the pain in his voice and the words, I almost cry every time I listen to it.
pink in the night or once more to see you by mitski
Changes- Black Sabbath 
So haunting
Harvest moon - Neal Young
I would have said Everlong by the Foo Fighters but someone already said that, so I’ll go with Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls

We watched our friends grow up together
And we saw them as they fell
Some of them fell into heaven
Some of them fell into hell
Sturgill Simpson's "Welcome To Earth (Polliwog)", about a father talking to his newborn son.

I can't say enough how much that song gets me. It's this weird mix of country and delicate lullaby. The strings behind the verses give you the best kind of chills. And the lyrics...I don't know how to convey the feeling it gives me as a dad.

I have never gotten through that entire song once without getting misty.
I'll be your baby tonight - Bob dylan
Foggy Dew

Unreleased Lana del Rey music: Afraid, I Talk to Jesus, and Say Yes to Heaven
[Ghost - Badflower](https://youtu.be/D_cjX5AYl8k)

So this song isn't "beautiful" in the way you would expect, as it does pertain to suicide, but honestly, I've never heard a song that made you feel what the singer *wants* you to feel quite like this one.

The way that you can hear the change in tone of his voice and music from being depressed when telling the story, to the intense build-up of doing it, to the chaotic nature after realizing it has begun, to the calmness when it's over.

I have never been suicidal, but holy hell, this song just makes me feel very heavy. It's a beautifully told story with the music that matches in all the right ways.
Pink Floyd - Time
Fall For Me - Sleep Token
‘Unforgettable’ …, that’s what you are….

Justice for Saint Mary by Diablo Swing Orchestra
Dandelion Wine, by Gregory Alan Isakov. My favorite artist for sure.
The night we met ft. Phoebe bridgers
Clair De Lune - Claude Debussy
Not only does the composer have a funny last name, but the song itself is one of the greatest classical piano pieces I've ever heard.
Holst “Jupiter”
Turn the Page - Bob Seger
Sleeping At Last - Saturn
When we dance by sting
Rebekah del Rios’s acapella  ‘Crying’ cover (Roy Orbison) ... it’s called “Llorando”

I really like watching where she sang it in the movie “Mulholland Drive.”
Hurt by Johnny Cash
”Star Shopping”

It’s been my favorite song ever since I discovered it 4 years ago. It’s just a guy talking about his feelings and unapologeticly being his true self while describing his emotions and all the thoughts going through his head at the time. In my opinion that’s as beautiful it gets, to hear raw emotions from someone who isn’t afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve and is brave enough to put it all out there for everyone to see and hear.
Hotel California and Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2
Many may disagree because his voice is prettt divisive, but “The Zephyr Song” by Red Hot Chili Peppers.

violent crimes by kanye west
Videotape - radiohead
Explosions In The Sky - Your Hand in Mine
Saturn by Sleeping at Last.
Clair de Lune by Debussy. I have no idea what the composer's thoughts were, but, to me it has always brought an image to mind of a perfect April rainstorm in the US southeast. A little light rain, a little bit of thunder, the downpour of rain followed by the silence of the storm's passing.  Then comes the sounds of water dripping and nature sipping that dew of life. Just exquisite.
Enigma [MCMXC a.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCMXC_a.D.)

Is still one of my favorite go to chill out albums of all time for a date or whatever. Hauntingly beautiful IMO. Hard to choose a single song on it, as I love them all, Sadness, Mea Culpa, Principals of Lust, etc.
Good enough by evanescence, stunning vocals, instrumental that makes your hairs stand on end and so much feeling
The live version of "snuff" by Corey Taylor in London. So much emotion in this one song always gives me goosebumps
Janis Ian At Seventeen is nearly perfect

Ten Years Gone - Led Zeppelin
Annie’s Song - John Denver
Love at 5 and Dime,  Nanci Griffith
Mahler symphony no.5
The Wailin' Jenny's cover of Wildflowers by Tom Petty is my pick. 

There are things I seek out when I have some cry feelings that need a release, such as movie/television scenes or songs or something from my childhood that will trigger it. This version of this already great song is a guarantee to open the floodgates. The live version is just as good, it's ridiculous.
Witchita Lineman -  Glen Campbell written by Jimmy Webb
Sleep - Eric Whitacre
Regina spector’s better isn’t the most beautiful song, but it sure is sweet.  Definitely recommend all of her music!
The song we sang that night didn't actually sound anything this song!

Suzanne by Leonard Cohen
Everything Means Nothing to Me-Elliott Smith
Í Gær - Sigur Rós
On the Turning Away - Pink Floyd 

I cry as I sing it, every time. Simultaneously hopeless and hopeful, breaks my heart and yet gives a little spark of optimism. It’s perfect.
Varúð by Sigur Rós gives me chills every time I listen to it.
Let Down - Radiohead
Probably Pacabel’s Canon in D.
The Chain by Fleetwood Mac
I mean it fluctuates personally almost every week, but from an objective as possible standpoint, I think Little Wing is up there.
Tom Waits - Alice
La vie en rose by Louis Armstrong, my favourite song that makes me so so happy whenever I hear it
How To Disappear Completely- Radiohead
Lucky Man - The Verve. It brings peace to my heart.

How to Disappear Completely - Radiohead
I Miss You (Robyn's Song) from the '92 Tom and Jerry movie. Yes Tom and Jerry. Beautiful song
Walk with you - dispatch
Kiss From A Rose - Seal
Larry Carlton Sleepwalk
Prelude - Above and Beyond
Cannibal Corpses- I cum blood, is pretty wholesome
Surprised I haven't seen it here yet but:
"Holocene" by Bon Iver
or maybe "Don't Talk (Put Your Head on my Shoulder)" by Beach Boys
Wings For Marie/ 10,000 Days - TOOL
The Parting Glass, any version
I do like Dance With The Devil by Immortal Technique as an example of a very deep song, I also love Murderers by John Fruiciante and Bunny and Ducks Boat House by YACHT.
Man, it was more the stage of life I was in at the time, but I have three that absolutely just take over my body when I hear them:

Radiohead - Street Spirit (Fade Out)
Radiohead -Exit Music (For A Film)
Fleet Foxes - White Winter Hymnal
Hallelujah, the Jeff Buckley version, and ONLY THE Jeff Buckley version!
There’s a rumor it was the effusive Cohen’s favorite cover of his song. True or not, it’s the best version ever of a hauntingly beautiful song.

once upon a time, i fell in love with a boy and this is the song that made me realize it, when i heard it on a mix he'd made for me. i swear this song is magic.
Avril 14th by Aphex Twins. Hands down.
Hurt, Nine Inch Nails
Instant Crush-Daft Punk
Hurt by NIN
Golden Age by Beck
It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks, but Whitney Houston's "The Greatest Love of All" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation, dignity. Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. Since, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial really. And it's beautifully stated on the album.
Purple rain , Prince
The Dark Night of the Soul, Loreena McKennitt
I’ll Be Seeing You. Don’t even know who did it. It’s from WWII times.
Comfortably Numb, don't think any other song has hit all the right spot for me :)
'Soul to Squeeze' by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It just has something so uplifting in a somewhat nostalgic way about it. The last verse 'When I find my peace of mind, I'm gonna keep it for the end of time' is something special to me for some reason
Radiohead - Nude

Radiohead - How to dissapear completely

Weezer - Only in dreams

Tool - Reflection

Porter Robinson - Sea of Voices
Nuvole Bianche by Ludovico Einaudi

https://youtu.be/4VR-6AS0-l4
I'm late to the game and perhaps showing my age it seems, but Van Morrison - Into The Mystic.   
The love that pours through over this song song for this love of his.  "I want to rock your gypsy soul". In my honest opinion, and after hearing it for over 40 years now (released in 1970, but i'm not old enough for that) this is the most beautiful song i can think of. So much heart.
Gallipoli by Beirut
“Three Little Birds” by Bob Marley and The Wailers. Really got me through some tough times
I don't really know why, but I get a really special feeling when listening to Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N' Roses. The guitar riff and baseline are ~~some of~~ the best I've ever heard. Maybe not my favorite song, but in my opinion is the most beautiful.
What a wonderful world,

This is specific AF but it's only on YouTube - Paul Cantelon,  Prologue Babushka from Everything is Illuminated played by Giorgio Giachi, user mrgiorgio1962.

To Build A Home by The Cinematic Orchestra
I'm an old man that has worked in the concert touring business since the late 80's and I recently found [Yiruma -River flows in you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7maJOI3QMu0), and that fucking shit is incredible. Gives me chills.

Six feet under - Billie Eilish
Rosyln - Bon Iver
Max Richter- on the nature of daylight
I’m old, so it has to be “Bridge over troubled waters” Simon and Garfunkel.
All these classical pieces and I haven’t seen Mozart at all yet while scrolling. I’m surprised!

Choir geeks might think it’s an over performed song, but Mozart’s *Ave verum corpus* is very beautiful 

Another choral song I’m fond of is *Trois beaux oiseaux* by Maurice Ravel
Stay Alive by Jose Gonzalez
Lights on the Lake (Horror PT. III) by Swallow the Sun.
Ode to joy still gives me goosebumps.
Comfortably numb... pink floyd.

You want it darker.... Leonard Cohen one of his very last songs.
O Mio Babbino Caro sung by Monserrat Caballe.
Om hundrede aar er alting glemt - Lumsk.
 eowyn falkenbach
Barber's Adagio for Strings, or the choral version titled Agnus Dei. The latter because no instrument yet devised can match the expressiveness of the human voice, but the former because it better captures that moment of cathartic, euphoric, breaking-of-a-storm moment in some indescribable way. 

Generations of composers, painters, musicians, poets, sculptors, filmmakers, artists of every kind have tried and failed to capture in art an emotion of that power and significance, if only for a moment. *Adagio for Strings* manages to harness that moment and hold onto it, a herculean task.
Nesum Dorma from Turandot
Interstellar Main Theme - Hans Zimmer
Revenge - Xxxtentcion 

Sad but beautiful at the same time
The Rain song by Led Zeppelin
Alot of Pink floyd songs achieve the rank of beautiful.   Fearless (meddle) is the first song I thought of
"Soma" by Smashing Pumpkins. The guitar solo bend in the middle kills me.
Don't let it bring you down - Annie Lennox version

There's also something magical about the intro to Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven

Exit music (for a film) - Radiohead
Time Leaper by Hinkik
Pink floyd - Echoes
Fixing A Hole, by The Beatles.

The song seems like Paul trying to get ahold of his depression and talking about his experiences with it. Something about the sincerity of his voice and the simple act of making repairs makes me find the will to push back, and stop my mind from wandering.
The Rain Song by Led Zeppelin

There is a Light that Never Goes Out, The Smiths
Never gunna give you up- Rick Astley

I have a slightly different definition of beautiful, but that song makes me cry of sadness and love at the same time. I do have to be in a strong frame of mind to listen to it though. We miss you Chester
In Australia there is a running radio spot called "Like a version" where bands will do a cover of a song. There have been some incredible ones, and average ones... But one day they had an Aussie band on called "something for Kate" and they covered "Sweet nothing" by Calvin Harris. I had to pull over the first time I heard it, it was just beautiful
Hallelujah - Jeff Buckley
Chi il bel sogno di Doretta sung by Kiri Te Kanawa
Live at Royal Albert Hall, David Gilmour with Crosby and Nash, [Shine On You Crazy Diamond.](https://youtu.be/5uiVpxDuAhc) A performance like no other.
Don't fear the reaper - Blue Oyster Cult.
Wish you were here by Pink Floyd, seriously. Every time I listen to it, it makes me miss so many people and think of life in a different way. I learned to play guitar for the sole purpose of playing this song, and I regret nothing.
 “Running over the same old ground, what have we found? The same old fears, wish you were here”

Edit: Spelling
Lazy afternoons - Kingdom of Hearts 365/2 days.

Beautiful.
Fight Fire With Fire - Metallica
Ramble on by Led Zeppelin.
Fall to Pieces - Velvet Revolver. 

The band reflecting the battle of addiction. Scott Weiland being locked in that spiral that would eventually claim his life. Sad, beautiful and prophetic.
Fuck it. Paradise by the Dashboard Light from Meat Loaf, respect the man. It's a rollercoaster of genres and fills you with joy. R.I.P.
I don't really know, but Daft Punk's Touch is a personal favourite
My Immortal by Amy Lee

Might sound like a generic heartbreak song to some, but Amy Lee’s vocals just boost the song so much for me. Her voice just grabs me, no matter what she sings about

Mother and Child Reunion by Paul Simon. Upbeat and sentimental. Always makes me think of my moms
My daughter wrote and played a song at my FIL's funeral. The crazy part is that she was supposed to sing a version of Hallelujah but did this instead without telling anyone but me until she played it. She's 19 and not as confident as she could be and this was super emotional because they were close.  It was absolutely beautiful.  Flawless IMO until the last note and then the floodgates opened for her but were very much already in full flow for me and everyone else there.
Rock n Roll suicide - David Bowie

it's a masterpiece and imo severely under rated

I don't know about the *most* beautiful, but I like it a lot, and I think it's underrated. :)
Pavarotti - Nessun Dorma.

Unless you speak Italian then when you actually read about what the story of the opera is about you just kind of always knew that's what this song was saying.

Alternative

Baz Luhrmann - Everybody's Free To Wear Sunscreen

It's a love letter to our youth. And I think the message is timeless. And again, the real story behind it is sweet. That the author of the piece wanted to write a hypothetical speech to give at a leaving school event.

And if you'll permit me a third contender

Curtis Mayfield - Move On Up

I just think this is the most joyous song ever written. The beat, the brass, the delight in his voice. I like to think of it as the ultimate pep talk. Fantastic soul tune.

Fuck it, I'm having a fourth

Virtually anything by Rachmaninoff. It's all so ethereal.
Radiohead- no surprises
Say Hello to Heaven by Temple of the Dog.
Fleet Foxes - Meadowlarks
WAP
Moonlight Mile - Rolling Stones
It's not my favourite song, but (ironically) Gordon Lightfoot's "Beautiful" might qualify for me. I never really thought much about him until I saw *The Brown Bunny*, which has this driving scene that is literally this song and a front car window, and it's gorgeous. I was like "I need to know what this is, right now".

I can't explain why I like it so much, something about that play between the guitar and the bass.

[https://youtu.be/bPMe9dMFHEA](https://youtu.be/bPMe9dMFHEA)

Even now, I'm listening to it for the first time in like... five years and I can't explain it. I don't normally like this kind of music at all, I'm an electronic-type guy, but this thing...
Mr Blue Sky by ELO
Moon by Kanye West
Kanye West - Moon

I know Reddit hates him but if you can put his personal antics aside it’s such a beautiful song
Stargazer, by Rainbow.

Beautiful is a very broad term for a song, but this is the first one that came to mind. I first heard it about 2 years ago and didn’t think much of it until I listened to it again some time later. It’s from the album ‘Rising’, so Ronnie James Dio is part of the band. I love his voice so much, he was like a walking instrument. The song is long, it has really good guitar solos, the lyrics are very strong, the drumming is amazing, the song generally flows very well but the climax at the end is what really gets me. I won’t spoil it, go listen to it; but I’ve listened to the song so many times, just to hear the climax. 

Dream Theater also made a cover, if you’re interested
Fast Car - Tracy Chapman

Running up that hill - Kate Bush

How to Disappear Completely by Radiohead
Pink Floyd- The Great Gig in the Sky

God that song gets me. The instrumentals are simultaneously haunting and mesmerizing, but the vocals are… sorta indescribable. To me that song just feels like raw existential pain made manifest. There’s a certain non-musicality to the vocals that make it feel raw, at the climactic points of her performance you can hear her wail with phlegm in her throat, as if she’s crying, normally a massive vocal taboo, and it’s a truly visceral effect
"Obstacles" by syd matters and "mt washington" by local natives
Avril 14 by aphex twin
Helpless - Crosby Stills Nash and Young
I can’t remember the best song in the world so I recommend  Tribute by Tenacious D
Face Down - The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus
The reason for my choice is the message the song conveys. It brings awareness to a situation that many people, especially women. If you haven’t ever heard it I’d recommend listening to it!
Just scrolling down this list and realizing... holy hell, how have we produced all of this in such a short period of time? Unreal. Human beings are unreal.
Dreams by The Cranberries
Longer  by Dan Fogelberg.

 I first heard this when I was 8 but I don't  know the title back then until I was 29 when it randomly appeared on my YouTube recommendations.
Teach Your Children - Crosby, Stills Nash & young

Bird Song - The Wailin' Jennys

Wildflowers - The Wailin' Jennys
Where did you sleep last night? By Leadbelly. The rumors surrounding his talents involved something about a deal at a crossroads…
Let Go, Frou Frou
The Promise by When in Rome.  It gives me goosebumps.
I don't know if I can give one definitive answer, but the first thing that sprang to mind was the fact that Poi Dog Pondering's cover of "I Had To Tell You" is pretty: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdXMWUG8LDs

For a completely different genre of music, how about the Percussion Cap remix of Fluke's "Bullet"?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIbfThiGFj8

How about a classic? Nick Drake's "Fly": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2HHpQWmJJQ

For something alternative and raw, Vorhees' "Black Horse Pike" is dreamy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9olkI4hgck

For a more conventional, poppy "girl with her geetar" one, how about Hazel English's "I'm Fine"? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYcp1bUb4lU

For another big-sounding one that's on the more popular end, I dig "Montage" from the Swiss Army Man soundtrack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrYCAHIccc8

Another epic one, albeit one with a lot of build-up; Goatman's "Baaneexu": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMSTHDd6zKE

To go more mellow again; Oumou Sangaré "Mogoya": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlmOSPnlmww

Some bluegrass because why not? The Critton Hollow Sting Band's "Johnny Cope": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M-BLtVjuW0

And finally Underworld's "Custard Speedtalk": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFHuXA4iKS8

I could honestly go on for a lot longer, but I've got to actually start to get up today and since I'm something like the 15,000th comment nobody is going to read this anyway let alone listen to everything I've posted. So that'll do.
It's hard to answer this question, I have two that come to mind that could fit this description:

Eric Clapton - Layla, MTV Unplugged version;
Frank Sinatra - That's Life

But the most beautiful for me is "Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves" by Annie Lennox and Aretha Franklin, that song has the most powerful lyrics I have ever heard, and next to the unmatched singers' voices it's just perfect.

Mad World - Gary Jules
Bon Iver - skinny love
Sergei Rachmaninoff - Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op. 43 Variation 18. 

Even if classical is not your thing, I highly recommend you give this song a listen. It's both beautiful and an absolutely clinic in music theory. When you hear the Paganini piece that Rachmaninoff was playing with your mind is going to be absolutely blown. 

It's without a doubt the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. Even if classical is not your thing, I recommend you give it a listen. This piece is only 2:46, so it is a short one.

In Denmark, they have a song here about a worker who is cutting rocks for cobblestones for making the road and who then dies after a lifetime of hard labor and where they didnt even give him a gravestone when he dies despite having given his whole life to pave the way for others.

Its beautiful and hard to not fell a tear for the poor fella and it has a beatiful melody.

Summer is Over, with Sara Bareilles (or pretty much anything she sings with that effortless voice of hers): https://youtu.be/By7YgbX3GuA
 
Parachute, by Ingrid Michaelson, acoustic version (the Way I Am coming a very close second, but the harmonies in this one are perfection): https://youtu.be/cF9IM0snoC4 
 
… lastly, a sleeper non-famous favourite, Jess Chalker’s Said the Raindrop to the Seed: https://youtu.be/0AW-LgDx_Qk (the words are just so gorgeous and wholesome and touching … this song has moved me to tears on several occasions)
 
Honourable mentions to Seal’s Kiss from a Rose, Bach’s Jesu Joy of Man’s Desiring, and Pachabel’s Canon (because played by a string quartet on a summer’s day that song is SO ridiculously moving and gorgeous, even if folks can claim it’s overexposed).
I Belong to You by Lenny Kravitz
If it means alot to you by A day to remember

"Life is Beautiful" by Lil Peep

It Is Well With My Soul.

No particular version, but the lyrics and background just make the song so beautiful to me. The writer lost his son in the Great Chicago Fire and then his four daughters when their ship sank crossing the Atlantic. Despite this tragedy, the writer found peace in his faith. It is a song both sad and touching, and altogether beautiful.
"Gravity" by Sara Bareilles. Absolutely beautiful voice.

"Fields of Gold" by Sting is a close second.

Even when I lose, I'm winnin'
Precious Pain by Melissa Etheridge, look up the back story, it's so sad.

Baby Got Back - Sir Mix a Lot
Uncle fucker
Two of my GOATS are the Titanic Suite (yes from the James Cameron movie) and the ending credits from Tales of Symphonia.
Lady - modjo
“What a Wonderful Life” by Louis Armstrong. It doesn’t always bring tears to my eyes but I always stop what I’m doing to enjoy it. Occasionally goose bumps
For me it's The Rain Song by Led Zeppelin. Lots of beautiful classical music out there too, but I've always felt a little removed from it; I connect with Zeppelin a lot more, so it hits harder for me.
Moonlight sonata
The two pieces of music that consistently give me goosebumbs are completely different from each other

1. Adagio for strings by Samuel Barber - it is classical music that is written from deep within the soul and penetrates my soul - it is amazing what a human being can compose. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAoLJ8GbA4Y
2. One Caress by Depeche Mode - the band is electronic / rock / dark but this song is magnificent. Its composition is atonal at times and it takes time to touch you deeply. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fphsbLtrDe8
Rachmaninoff's 2nd piano concerto... 3rd is also pretty great, but the 2nd concerto is on its own level
Drift Away by Uncle Kracker. I’ve loved this song my whole life, but it hits a little different now that I understand the lyrics.
Experience- Ludovico Einaudi.

A lot of teens are playing it as a distorted 6-second version ok Tiktok to see if *someone texted you back* - but I discovered this song while driving through a road between a lake during a sunset on Classic FM. Eveything was sepia. I recommend you ALL to listen to it at least once tonight & tell me about it later
 
Spoiler, it's classical but itll rock your world.
Ave Maria comes to mind
too many to evaluate but off the top of my head Primavera by Ludovico Einaudi. literally the embodiment of dancing with the fairies. that or Ride On by Christy Moore, always gets me
Rachmaninov piano concerto # 2

“All by myself” was ripped off from the second movement ;)
Fields of Gold by Sting
Sur aria - from Mozart's the marriage of Figaro I'd so incredibly beautiful. And even more beautiful when. You hear it's just a couple of girls having a little bitch about a guy. So normal, so beautiful. Jaw dropping harmonies
Miles Davis - Blue in Green.

Untouchable.
Erik Satie - Gymnopédie No. 1
Tchaikovsky's [Pas de Duex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5USHu6D6U) from The Nutcracker.

I have listened to a LOT from the greatest composers of all time, and I struggle to believe there is a piece more beautiful than that one. Yes there are a lot of beautiful pieces out there, but this one remains the top for me. 

I would say the finale to Malher's 2nd symphony gets my 2nd place.
Cat Stevens' version of  "Morning Has Broken"
No such thing as the "most beautiful" but Debussy's Clair de Lune always transports me to a sacred place. Also, Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings.
Not seeing any R&B in here, so to mix it up, going to throw in Breathe Again by Toni Braxton.
« Dance with the devil » from immortal technique, such a powerful and disturbing song. I truly recommend
"Doin' Your Mom" by FAttY SPiNS. Give it a listen.
Almost anything Frank ocean has made.
Gymnopédie No 1 by Erik Satie
Baby shark!
**Everywhere at the end of time by The Caretaker,**

Its very sad actually, but short ago I listened to it for the first time and man, I really didnt enlisted for that hell of a ride
New Radicals - You Get What You Give, might be cheesy to some but it has a warm place in my heart, also it has some nostalgia to it because I remember hearing it in Surf's Up at the end when I was a kid
I am surprised on quick scroll I haven't seen any Metallica, I think some of the most beautiful songs come from meral genre. 
Unforgiven or Nothing Else Matters by Metallica have to be up there. (Even Elton John's, Miley Cyrus et al. Nothing Else Matters is worthy)

But I am deeply in love with Chlorine and Wine by Baroness. That will never fail to get me.
Yellow - Coldplay

 Toxic, by Britney
The most upvoted songs are SO white X0
“Hot in Herre” by Nelly
I.... don't know.

I was high on shrooms and it was so beautiful and made me feel so happy. Couldn't even hum the tune if I tried. Not a damn clue, but I wish I could go back to those 3 minutes where the music made me feel *pure joy*
As a music person, this is tough to answer. There are sooo many songs and pieces I could add to this thread. I’ll give you my top pick and one that surprised me.

My top pick is Samuel Barber’s “Adagio for Strings”. It’s my favorite to play and listen to because Barber packs so much emotion in. It was originally written as the second movement for one of his quartets (Op. 11), but arranged it as a separate work for string orchestra. It’s somewhat difficult to perform well, but so beautiful. (Technically, it’s a piece since it does not have words, but I’m recommending it anyways.)

One that surprised me is Nicki Minaj’s “Grand Piano”. It showcases a totally different side of her voice. I only found it because it was shuffled into a Pandora mix or Spotify playlist, but am so glad it was recommended to me. It deserves to be heard more often.
Claire de Lune - Claude Debussy
Fix You by Coldplay
Debussy, Clair De Lune from Suite Bergamasque 

What else is there?
ok this is basic af but canon in d and ode to joy.
Never Gonna Give You Up

I think Gran Torino feat Clint Eastwood is really pretty in a gritty way. The movie is excellent too!
your mom's moans
1/6 Out of The Gravity - bocariodo P
A hope carol
The Dreamer by Amigo the Devil. It turns dark real quick but somehow the song stays beautiful despite the stalker/ murderer vibes in the end
I don't know what it was called but when I was younger my mum would play me some music and there was this one song and it was so good 

the guy sounded sad but my mum told me it was something about stress from working type things or something like that it probably was a bit darker but my mum pulled out a basic meaning to make it less bad ,it wouldn't have been the first time she'd have explained things to me in a way as i was young
I don't know about most, but Avalanche by Cellar Darling is up there

"We wandered through quiet lands, felt the first breath of snow,
Searched for the last pigeon, slate gray I've been told.
Stumbled on a daffodil which she crushed in the rush,
Heard it sigh and left it to die.
At once felt remorse and were touched by the loss of our own,
Held its poor broken head in her hands, dropped soft tears in the snow
And it's only the taking that makes you what you are."

Con Te Partiro - Andrea Bocelli.  It was not Bocelli but a traveling performer.  I was in a swim suit on a cruise ship and accidentally opened the concert hall doors.

To me this song is the auditory equivalent of beautiful, there is something so sickly sweet about it and the way her voice paired with her guitar just come together and make you feel all mooshy and gross. 
Every time I hear it, it makes the hipster emo in me want to vomit everywhere and I fucking love it.

Here’s to hoping it makes some of you vomit too.

I Will Follow You by Toulouse
Good Riddance by Darren Korb ft. Ashley Berrett.


It's from the Hades videogame, and is one of the most hauntingly bittersweet things I've ever heard. It's a duet sang by two former lovers (Orpheus and Eurydice) that find themselves seperated in the afterlife. Eurydice has found peace and a sense of calm in her new existence, while Orpheus bitterly mourns his seperation from Eurydice and hates himself for failing to rescue her while he was still alive.


They both sing the same lyrics to the same melody, but they sing completely *different* songs. It's so damn beautiful it makes me ache.
Cheering Bridge/Goodbye by David Shire (score)
Cantique de Jean Racine
For context: music is a [kinesthetic](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/kinesthetic) experience for me. The vibrations are something that need to move me the right way basically.

On that basis, the less lyrics the better so I tend to listen to a lot of instrumental/synthetic sounds. I like to decide for myself how a song makes me feel. I’m a huge fan of Lindsey Sterling. [The Phoenix ](https://youtu.be/2i4BJFjCPlo) is a very nice one. I hope the link works, enjoy!

The Waters of March by Antonio Carlos Jobim. It has everything in it, joy, sadness, mundane, infatuation, dissonance, love, peace and purpose. Whatever mood I'm in, it relates and makes me feel better after. There might prettier songs, but as music I find it beautifully touching.
Actually from a video game. It’s called Odyssey (Greek version) the translation is stunning and vocals as well
Without doubt it is [Danza Di Cala Luna by Inti Illimani](https://youtu.be/iYiREBIHEX0). There is the beautiful melody, but then there are about 4 or 5 different counter melodies with it. The musicianship in it is staggering. It builds to a beautiful crescendo that is tear-jerking to me.

Unchained Melody - The Righteous Brothers
Not the song in particular, but the delivery.

It was a clip from Malinda on TikTok 'when somebody loved me'. She's known as the Siren and does a lot of Celtic songs. But her voice man, the emotion you feel when you listen to her is something I rarely get to experience.

It was a very rough year last year. Among many other things, being told you had a higher chance of dying in childbirth because of a medical condition just topped of the ginormous shit-sandwich that was 2021.

Then there i was, sitting in my hospital bed alone with my baby girl snoozing contently and soundly in my arms, and I see this on TikTok. Just.....tears. so, so many tears and much sobbing. Just wanting someone to love me like that, and determined to make sure I be this person for my 2 girls. It only goes for like 30 seconds, but I'd give anything for her to sing the full song. I highly recommend.

Dream On by Aerosmith.
I was at a house party and a guy was DJing with some interesting vintage records he'd found. He found a "Bible verses read aloud" record and I was enjoying some psychedelics. Just as the high was coming on very nicely, he started mixing this record in, so there was this simplified Genesis story complete with angelic chorus background and soft bass beats. I'm being sucked into the speaker as the music swells. The deep, soothing voice doing the narration becomes more intense. 
"And God said...*let there be light*" followed by an epic bass drop that make my brain leak out my ears and I experienced stimulus bliss. 
I'm not religious, it was just a really well done set that sounded epic af

Ailein duinn ("Dark-haired Alan") is a traditional Scottish song for solo female voice, a lament that was written in Gàidhlig for Ailean Moireasdan ("Alan Morrison") by his fiancée, Annag Chaimbeul ("Annie Campbell"). 

[Ailein Duinn ](https://youtu.be/3qkSNZ3agmI)Ailean Moireasdan was a sea captain from the isle of Lewis. 

In the spring of 1786 he left Stornoway to go to Scalpay, Harris, where he was to be engaged to Annag Chaimbeul ("Annie Campbell").

Unfortunately, they sailed into a storm and all the crew sank with the vessel, off the coast of the Shiant islands. 

The broken-hearted Annag wasted away through grief and composed this lament for her lost love. Annag lost her will to live and died a few months afterwards. 

Because there was not enough soil on the barren island of Scalpay, her father took her in her coffin by boat to a cemetery on the main island of Harris.

However, a storm caused the coffin to be blown off her father's boat and it washed up on the same island her fiancé's body had been found.

Cherry by RATATAT
Landslide by oh wonder
I just can't get over that "Sound and Fury" album by Sturgill Simpson.

It's that newest one with a lot of his experimental styles, and is practically a way of seeing someone break out as someone new.
Sturgill was almost out of it with a drug problem making typical country music and then He flipped the switch and just said "Fuck it, I wanna rock out with some electric funk on this too" , and made a statement out of the conformity and fakeness of the country genre.

But these fucking songs. These lyrics.
It's more than that wild sound that's getting with me but for once I feel a singer with some actual emotions I relate to in his words.

"Sing Along" especially. I see myself singing that on stage with all the pent up anger I have over my own Ex-love and it feels fucking good to have that daydream.

And "Make Art not Friends".


I highly recommend this album, everyone. Start to finish, listen to the whole thing, watch the videos, and see the new Sturgill Simpson.

That man lit a fire that feels like mine.
Everybody is a Star by Sly and the Family Stone. All the vocal performances just make me pause and take in every word.
Brokedown Palace - The Grateful Dead
One that comes to mind is Picture Me Better by Weyes Blood
Old Now by Rosemary & Garlic. Absolutely stunning.
Have A Nice Life - Music Will Untune The Sky
How coincidental this question was asked.  I don't think anything can top the Harp Twins' cover of [*Rainbow Connection*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZwPmhF_rmw).  I thought nothing could improve on the song, but today, I was wrong.
Bohemian Rhapsody

Deliver me - Sarah Brightman
Green Grass and High Tides by The Outlaws.
A Sky Full of Stars-Coldplay
Not even trying to be all *OOoo LoOk At mE I lIsTeN tO ClAsSiCaL mUsIc"* but Miserere Mei, Deus by Gregoreo Allegri is hands down one of the most gorgeous songs ever written.

Listen to it.
Spirit in the sky. It puts me in a good mood about death, which is strange but comforting.
Can we kiss forever - Kina 

Ps. This song with noise canceling headphones in a dark room will make you rethink your existence
A Song For You by Donny Hathaway. It was one of my dads favorite songs. I cry whenever I hear it.
Rest of my life, by Bruno Mars - I first heard it in the wedding scene on Jane the Virgin.
Bohemian Rhapsody
This is my “break glass in case of emergency”. I can’t imagine anything being this beautiful/comforting for me. It’s saved my life multiple times: https://youtu.be/TvZUqj_HSa8

Lamento della ninfa - Jordi Savall and Montserrat Figueras
Silent Lucidity - Queensryche
A think [this performance](https://youtu.be/C97H_HvBjPA) of Mediterranean Sundance is a contender. But the thing is, it's not really a song. It's a musical conversation. Even from an old recording you can feel the feverish flow of energy between Paco and Al as they play, watching the subtle nods and the glances, cueing each other, playing off of one another.
And it's clearly a scripted, much rehearsed kind of thing thing, but it's so fucking RAW. I don't think I've ever heard a performance overflowing with feeling like this. Just absolutely bursting at the seams with any emotion you can conceive of.

Devil’s Trill Sonata in G Minor or Vivaldi’s Requiem

‘Stay’ by Jorane. Watch the video. She has a fixation with her hands/fingers.
Maggot Brain by Funkadelic.

Name has no relation to the song itself.
[The song in the final fantasy xiv trailer](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h542YbZuwkQ) gives me chills everytime I hear it. Mainly around the 5 minute mark.

Just thinking about it has me balling. Fuck.
Stale Cupcakes.


I dunno why, but this song kinda means a lot to me so much, I wanna remember it forever.
Annie Lennox did a wonderful job with "Into the West." It's not the most beautiful song I've ever heard, but I think it reaches the full potential of catharsis for the end of _The Lord of the Rings_.
Let it go by

Great question.  I was stuck debating many different recorded tunes in my head when suddenly the clouds lifted as I realized live music counts too, duh.  Without question the most beautiful song I have ever heard (or expect I ever will hear) is Amazing Grace on the bagpipes.  Granted, I'm usually at funerals when I hear it (not always), but the power of the pipes and the beauty of that song rock me to my core.

Samba Pa ti
I like the song eidelwise from the sound of music
Angelmaker - Eating the Body of God. 

This is a weird one because it’s technically deathcore, not what most people would call a “beautiful song”. However, though the song has dark lyrics and is overall depressing, the reason the song is beautiful is because you can seriously feel the emotion behind the song. It’s not anger, rage or any of that, it’s just sadness. Even without knowing the lyrics or anything, and despite being deathcore, you can really feel the grief in the voice and overall tone of the song. 

Magnificent performance by Angelmaker, my Canadian brothers
Varúð- Sigur Rós. Heard it in the “Mac comes out of his Shell” episode of IASIP.
Couple of strong contenders:

- 3rd Movement of Shostakovich Symphonies 5 and 11
I know it's over by the smiths
There's an orchestral version of "Fix You" by Coldplay that legit had me crying from its beauty the first time I ever heard it.
Waiting and Waltzing in Airport Terminals by Industries of the Blind. Not too well known, but the three songs that album (Chapter 1: Had We Known Better) are some of the most well put together and meaningful songs I've ever heard, despite the lack of lyrics.

White Ferrari- Frank Ocean
Vincent, it’s the vibe when ur camping or just outside at night
My Sweet Lord - George Harrison
Miséréré mi, Deus by Allegri. Composed in the 1600s, it wasn’t allowed to be transcribed. Mozart heard it as a teenager and transcribed it by ear. Source: I don’t know, Wikipedia! Don’t take my word on the back story, just listen to this stunning and ethereal piece of music. The version by Kings College is the best, IMO.

Edit: added the King’s recommendation.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JdVBULKACg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JdVBULKACg) This one around 9:33 both musicians are tearing up. It's an amazing piece of music

Lacuna Coil, Heaven's a Lie.
FAttY SPiNS-Doin' Your Mom
Hans Zimmer - time
If I fall by Amber Pacific

Most people here probably don't know it. I think it hits me hard because it was my go to song when my childhood best friend died and it was the first song I sang for my wife when we started dating. Its more sentimental than anything.
I don't know if it can quantify as most but pretty high on the list is Estrella by Brave Saint Saturn.  It's from an album called The Light Of Things Hoped For, and there's a lot of songs on there that just bring me to tears. Estrella was the first one to come to mind
I Found by Amber Run (slowed)
Tank park salute - Billy Bragg

Love was really gone by Makoto Matsushita
I would say Goodbye to a world as it evokes so much sadness and ending's. It feels like everything fell apart but then again it makes me feel sad but happy
"L'Heure Exquise" by Reynaldo Hahn. Look for a recording of Susan Graham (album "La Belle Époque") - her voice and interpretation of it is amazing.
Obviously it has to be Shyann Weeps by The Plot in You. It’s such a beautiful song!
I Can't Make You Love Me-Bonnie Raitt. 
The pleading and sorrow in her voice is palpable.
Somewhere Over the Rainbow
Pijon "Cache Cache Party"
Bridge over troubled water by Simon and Garfunkel

Depends on how you are feeling atm but in general I would say its [You keep coming back like a song by Red Garland.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMYePiJ7Atg&ab_channel=RedGarland-Topic)
Faraón love shady - soy guapo obviously
Idk, I think that is so regional.
Luis Miguel Historia de Amor. I cry every time
One More Light by Linkin Park. The backstory of the song is hella sad but it makes it more beautuful
Constant Craving, J.D. Lang. Just sends chills down my spine.
Nothing Can Change This Love by Sam Cooke.
Nothing else matters by metallica
Alison by Elvis Costello. Bittersweet and sad, but there is some hope here and there. But it’s hope that the singer will never get to experience.
Dear God by Confetti. 

Sums up my views on religion and the world pretty neatly

Without knowing much spanish or even looking up the lyrics' translation I find the song so soothing and luscious.  I've found it breathtaking for years.
[James Vincent McMorrow - if I had a boat](https://youtu.be/e2XPDP6KkkE)

Idk why I love it but I do.
Harvest moon by Neil Young
Avaline-S3RL. That or What a Wonderful World
When I think of songs that fill me with that beautiful aching sense of nostalgia for something you can’t quite put your finger on, a few artists come to mind.

Panda Bear: Check out “I’m Not”, “Search for Delicious”, and “Benfica”.

The Velvet Underground: Have a listen to “Sunday Morning”, “I’m Set Free”, “Candy Says”, and “I Found a Reason”.

The Carpenters: “Close to You” and “We’ve Only Just Begun”

The Beach Boys: “God Only Knows” and “Don’t Worry Baby”

Vashti Bunyan: Most of the album “Just Another Diamond Day”

Brian Eno: “On Some Faraway Beach”, “Spider and I”, too many songs to name on the albums “Another Green World” and “Evening Star”, plus the gorgeous meanderings of “Music for Airports” and Discreet Music”

Nick Drake: pretty much everything but especially “Fly” and “Pink Moon”
Varúð by Sigur Rós is definitely that for me.
Coma White - Marilyn Manson
God Only Knows - The Beach Boys
Wooden heart by listener
Beauty and the Beast medley

Now f\*ck off
"Such a Simple Thing" by Ray LaMontagne.
Death with Dignity by Sufjan Stevens

Samba Pa Ti - Santana

Hey Stranger - Mandolin Orange

Two Points - Deb Talan
The gate theme from pokemon black white
Hard not to consider “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” by The Beach Boys.
Not just one song but multiple songs. Anything that Lana del ray puts out is super euphoric to me. Especially when I’m high off my ass, then you can hear all the instruments. It’s especially noticeable on her song “groupie love” with A$ap Rocky!
Gravity - John Mayer (live of course)
A lot of potential answers here but my first thought was the Pink Floyd song high hopes off the division bell record….I think the live version off the pulse record might be better.
The Predatory Wasps of the Palisades Are Out To Get Us! - Sufjan Stevens
Fear A Bhata-Alison Helzer
Greensleeves.
In the Middle by Lilly & Madeleine
Godspeed - Frank Ocean
Song For Sienna by Brian Crain

Chris Cornell’s version of Nothing Compares to you is BEAUTIFUL!

I Hear a Symphony - Cody Fry
Here comes the sun by the Beatles
Barcelona, Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballe. I cry every time.
Anathema - Violence

It’s a must that you listen to it as loud as you can.
Aaliyah-Missing You
Ne Obliviscaris- Forget Not
Probably Invincible by TOOL. Idk, the vibe the song gives off, the desperation in MJK's vocals, Danny Carey's drums, Adam Jones's riffs, ahhhh it's all so good
Que Sera Sera, especially violin and piano covers and Oh Danny Boy
Good luck listening to them. Tommy's song by grayscale
Lucid by Tex Perkins and the Dark horses or

[Passionflower - Jon Gomm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY7GnAq6Znw)

Through the Tides - Fish in a Birdcage.
Ween - Tears for Eddie
See You Again by The Tyler, The Creator
I've heard once a tribute to the best song in the world does that count?
*I Will Never Forget* - Kimya Dawson. It’s just so incredibly sad and beautiful, I honestly don’t even know how to explain it. I wish I could relive the first time I heard it. I cried so much. It makes me feel bad now that I’m numb to it’s message/story.
The Inner Light (full version) from Star Trek The Next Generation. Maybe it's the connection to the episode that does it for me though.
Disenchanted by MCR. That good old days.
Moonlight in Vermont
To build a home by the cinematic orchestra. It’s such a Blissful tune.
The answer changes all the time but today I would say Best of Times from Dream Theater
When A Blind Man Cries —Deep Purple
Banshee Beat - Animal Collective
Guts theme from berserk
It's unlikely anyone here will know this song, but its so beautiful I cried the first time I heard it.

Loathe - Is It Really You?

Adam's Ribs - Jensen McRae
Chappel Roan singing “Bitter”, I saw her live and she has the voice of an actual angel

* *Everything* by Lifehouse
* *Halo* by Oleander
* *Gone in Bloom and Bough* by Caspian
Hotel Womb - The Church
Lazarus by porcupine tree
Sweet As Whole by Sara Bareilles
Tough pick between Adagio for Strings (the version performed for Homeworld) and Time from the Inception soundtrack.

Hear it in the right state of mind you see things fall into place .  The song it self is like magic it's mind blowing .

Sing about me, I’m dying of thirst
Let Down by Radiohead.
In terms of something beautiful specifically my mind immediately goes to soundtracks tbh, and my first thought there was Dragonsong by Nobuo Uematsu from FFXIV. I've also always had a soft spot for The Lighting of the Beacons from Return of the King, the theme for Rohan is also amazing. For something less orchestral and more in the realm of popular music I'll go with Lightning Crashes by Live.
Tracks #3 (aka "Rhubarb") and #20 (aka "Lichen") from *Selected Ambient Works Volume II* by Aphex Twin almost made me tear up when I first listened to them.

That, and "Mice On Venus" from Minecraft's soundtrack.
Ryan Woodward's 'Thought of You,' with this animation makes me cry almost every single damned time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBk3ynRbtsw

Somewhere Over the Rainbow- Judy Garland

 The Girl from Ipanema - Getz/Gilberto

Yesterday - The Beatles

Beauty and the Beast - Original soundtrack.
Changes by 2Pac. I rarely see it getting mentioned, but this song reflects perfectly the life of people of color in America. 2Pac understood and described the situation so well, that every single words on that song are still relatable to this day.
And I love her - Beatles
Master & a Hound by Gregory Alan Isakov with The Colorado Symphony
Tori Amos - 1,000 Oceans

It’s Always Been You - Phil Wickham

Bottom of a Heartbreak - Needtobreathe 

Two lesser known songs by artists not many on this thread have likely heard of. Both voices are unique, but opposite ends of the vocal spectrum.
Light of the seven.
All heart from portrait of Ella Fitzgerald by Duke Ellington. The trumpet really sings.
Rachmaninof 3rd sonata
Man, I have a whole list, but I'll keep it to a few for now. Flower Dance by DJ Okawari, Lethal Drug by Avicii, and Coloratura by Coldplay. 

Flower Dance has beautiful composition, and listening to it, it truly feels like flowers dancing.

Lethal Drug is an amazing song and I'm really sad it was never officially released. Listening to it honestly makes me feel like I'm floating

Coloratura is one of my favourite songs of all time, and honestly almost feels otherworldly to listen to. It's awesome

“For Mom” by Buckethead
Gymnopedie No. 1 by Erik Satie
It was Jeff Buckley covering Hallelujah but I want every version of that song locked up for at least 30 years.
How the actual fuck can I not find To Build a Home - The Cinematic Orchestra. Even better if you sandwich it with the whole album since the first and last track are the same composition.

blackbird - the Beatles
Something - The Beatles. Paul’s bass line in that song belongs in the Louvre.
Pale Blue Eyes, Between the Bars, The Night we Met
Maybe just me. But I'm a diehard Beatles fan. Let it Be, Yesterday, or that one song that's played alot in Sing 1... forgot its name
30/90 in my opinion. it's a good song if you haven't seen tick tick boom, but if you have seen it it had a very different meaning

Listen on a chilly night.
Might not be everyone's cup of tea, but [Narayan by The Prodigy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzVjZu4fl4o) is one of the most beautiful songs that I found 'on my own'. 

Every time I listen to it, I can close my eyes and instantly be transported to friday afternoon after school in my senior year. Standing out front of the school, portable Panasonic CD Player in hand, feeling the cool breeze gently hitting my face. Seeing the trees at the end of the school lot gently swaying and leaves shimmering. The occasional person walking by, the cars on the road across from the school coming and going. Just being 'in the moment' because the song was so awesome I had to stop walking to my car to just enjoy it. 

Every song on that album is a banger, but there's just something special about this song that just sucks you in.

Then it ends and you realize you've been gone from the world for almost 10min and are kind of sad that the moment is gone.

This song is my happy place.
Quero Esquecer Você by Jorge Ben. He has so many gorgeous songs though, it’s hard to choose. Oba, Lá Vem Ela; Chove Chuva, etc.

Same for Paul Robeson. His voice gives me goosebumps. Traditional songs like Swing Low, Sweet Chariot and By an’ By hit you right in the feels, but you can’t beat Ol’ Man River for sheer power.
Blind Willie Johnson - Dark was the night...
Led Zeppelin - Thank You
Our House by CSNY.
Cat Stevens- The Wind
The mind electric by miracle musical
Just any Nier song they're all so beautiful. SO many songs sound like you'd find them in a chapel sung by a choir

Personal favorites though are: [Nier Replicant: Song of the Ancients - Devola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCKEXPXtrEU) (This one had a version played at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics)

[Nier Automata: Amusement Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihg_NWJ3Lvs)

[Nier FF14 Raid: Kaine's Salvation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk3g9U7MjVk) This version is a combo with another Drakengard song and the Final Fantasy theme (Yes Drakengard is part of the Nier Lore and so is this FF14 raid) and I find it the most beautiful

Edit: There is no meaning to the lyrics as they're in Chaos Language which has no translation.

Either Strangeness and Charm or Addicted to Love by Forence + The Machine. Her voice is gorgeous and it's a perfect way to describe the way I feel about falling in love. Just a beautiful pairing of the content and the execution of the songs.
Most beautiful has to be Reckoner by Radiohead, the only way I can describe how my mind hears/sees that song is that it feels like it's raining with colors.
Mad Hatters and Mona Lisa's....
Set fire to the rain by Adele. I used to listen to that song with my stepdad all the time and he always told me to appreciate good music

About black rights and slavery, my favourite song, it’s peaceful, sends a good message, and calming
Diphylleia grayi - Jonghyun
His voice in this song is very soothing and beautiful
La mezquita de Cordoba. Beautiful wind ensemble piece that combines music of the 3 major religions based off a mosque in Spain that was never torn down through Christian or moorish rule. It was converted to mosques and cathedrals multiple times, but never torn down like what happened to most of the religious buildings as Spain was inhabited by different people. But either way, the music is absolutely beautiful and/or exciting throughout. One of my favorite pieces to listen to and play.

Also, a bit more well known, but jupiter by Gustav holst. Well pretty much anything by Gustav holst tbh, first suite in e flat and 2nd suite in f (mightve gotten those backwards) are both really beautiful. Particularly the 4th movement in 2nd suite. Some movements are more exciting and i wouldn't exactly consider the marches (1 movement in eaxh suite) to be beautiful, but both suites have some really beautiful movements.

I don’t know. That’s the worst part. I’m haunted by how beautiful the song was, but I remember almost nothing about it. 

I was driving home after babysitting my niece. It was late at night (my sister was going to night school to become a teacher.)

My son was asleep in his car seat, so I’m guessing this was 1994-ish. 

I’d just driven through a ravine that was filled with fog, and a (nearly?) full moon. As I emerged from the ravine, this song started playing. 

It was a country channel, but it wasn’t like any country song I’d ever heard. The singer sounded like Alison Krauss (though I think I’ve gone through every song of hers I can find and haven’t found it). 

The only fragment of lyric I remember was something about the moon. 

After the song finished, the dj said, “That was beautiful. Let’s play that again.” And he did.

Two play throughs were just long enough for me to make it home. 

I do wish I could find that song, though.

Dearly Beloved

Listen, I was a kid, got Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 ReMIX (yeah I know) for the ps3, like in that time I didn't know anything about game reviews or nothing I just saw Micky, Donal and Goofy in a cool covert and got the game as a birthday present

It was the first game with actual story that I completed, before that I just played dragon ball fighting games or gta not doing missions and just driving around

To be honest I remember not understanding the story, at all, now I know that's normal while playing kingdom hearts but I remember getting really attached to the characters and hearing that damn song is just and pure nostalgia that makes me cry

Anything by Sigur Rós. Also doubles as the saddest
I can't pick just one, so here's a few:

"Amelia" by Joni Mitchell. Ugh, I can't stop my chest and heart from emotional waves that move in sync with her guitar playing. Her lyrics are always fantastic, but there's something otherwordly about her instrumental choices in this one.

"Song To The Siren" by Tim Buckley. When I am in a vulnerable place it can really make me cry. It reminds me of a previous relationship in which I contributed to its breakdown.

"Gymnopedie No. 1" by Erik Satie is also one that evoked intense emotions of time passing and growing out of my youth during an acid trip.

"So I'm Growing Old On Magic Mountain" by Father John Misty. Very nostalgic and tear jerking. Again, about the passing of youth.

Others which I may or may not get around to adding my interpretations:

"Autumn Leaves", "Woodstock", and "Dark Eyed Molly" covers by Eva Cassidy

"Cloudbusting" by Kate Bush

"A Change Is Gonna Come" by Sam Cooke

"She/He Moved Through The Fair" cover by Sinead O'Connor or Loreena McKennitt

An Ode to Lost Jigsaw Pieces by Enter Shikari. I've listened to it all of about 3 times because I just can't bring myself to listen to it more than that. It's incredibly beautiful, but it's very sad.
Arithmetic - Brooke Fraser
Bathe In The River - Mt Raskil Preservation Society ft Holly Smith 

Both are NZ artists and it's crazy to think that majority of the world is unaware of their talent

Les yeux fermés by LYNN

Amazing Grace, a cappella, in the Kiowa language

Sin tu latido (luis eduardo aute)
Any country's anthem, *specifically mine*
Enigma - return to innocence 

The video with the music really makes you think about life.
Metal Heart by Cat Power
Most anything by Alison Krause. 

Her voice is amazing.
Rainbow Body by Christopher Theofanidis
terraform by novo amor and ed tullet
The one from 5th Element -_-
I really like Punks and Poets by Elliot Root, idk if other people would consider it beautiful though
Frank Ocean - White Ferrari
Candle on the Water. Helen Reddy, on the soundtrack for, of all things, "Pete's Dragon"
Now We Are Free from the end/credits of Gladiator (2000). I still get major chills every time I hear it.  

Claire de Lune and Gymnopedie No. 1 truly tied for 1st for me but they were elsewhere in the thread. 

From the Last of the Mohicans soundtrack Promontory and Elk Hint are another two very powerful yet beautiful classical-style pieces. The entire score really is something else. Same for Gladiator and even Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.
Un Musicien Parmi Tant D Autres by Harmonium
The Rainbow Connection always gets me.
Orbital - Halcyon And on And On
Decks Dark by Radiohead. Hauntingly beautiful, had a real wtf moment the first time I heard it because I've had a dream of exactly what's described in the song.
I forgot the name but the one from howls moving castle
I don't want to talk about it...Rod Stewart
Too many to choose from, but the two that have been hitting me lately are:

"Just Breathe" by Pearl Jam
"Better Life" by Joshua Radin
This is 190% getting lost but I need to put it out there. Jason isbell's "if we were vampires takes the cake. It is beautiful and sad, and make you understand that the fact that life is precious and limited makes it all the more beautiful and worth cherishing
Stick Figure - Once in a Lifetime.

Makes me think about my life and what the future will hold for me.
Clair de Lune from Ocean's 11
You Said x Young Thug
My Immortal- Evanescence
Rock song? Let Down by Radiohead. 

Song in general? Ave Maria by the Three Tenors

Musical composition? Beethoven 5th
Stardust- written by Hoagy Carmichael recorded by Nat King Cole is my favorite version
The First Hunter, the final boss theme in Bloodborne.

I can't think of a better example of "tragic" final boss music. Like how it's a travesty how these two people are fighting. It's the ideal piece of music for any situation where two people who shouldn't be fighting...are fighting. You could play this music during the duel beween Obi-Wan and Anakin in Revenge of the Sith and it would fit perfectly.
Jealous- labyrinth 

Real love- Tom Odell 

Hide and seek- Imogen heap

The blowers daughter- Damien rice

When I first heard "in dreams" by Sierra Ferrell god damn it hit hard, she has one hell of a voice. If you do search for it look for the GemsonVHS version cause that one is better than on her album I find
Surfacing - Slipknot
Stolen by Dashboard Confessional
Pictures of You - The Cure.
I think I could go a few different ways with this: 

**Evenstar, Howard Shore, from the LotR Two Towers OST**

Probably the first piece of music to get a tear out of me, aside from when I was three and apparently got very upset that Lisa Stansfield had completely misplaced her wain.

**Death of Music, Devin Townsend, Live at Albert Hall**

Really takes you somewhere. In fact the triptych of Funeral, Bastard, and Death of Music, played as a continuous piece at that concert, is just wonderful.

**Ghost Love Score, Nightwish, Live at Wacken 2013**

The operatic metal genre hymn. Sounds beautiful, goes places, and finishes on a literal high.

**Cardigan, Taylor Swift, Folklore**

Don’t @ me. I love this song. I listened to this album so much last year my Spotify Rewind was “Top 5 genres: Folk Metal, Folk Music, Viking Folk, Prog Rock, Prog Metal. Top Artist: Taylor Swift”.
Elegy by Daniel elder
Morrissey - Suedehead
Somewhere Over The Rainbow, interpreted by IZ

Porcupine Tree - Collapse the light into Earth

Tears For Fears - break it down again

Empire of the Sun by Edenbridge

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CO36LQXQ5VE
Gone away- the offspring

31 yo male, literally made me cry just a couple hours ago.. every damn time I hear it.

The sound of silence - disturbed live on conan
Thrice - The Whaler

Details the thoughts of a sailor who has to leave his family to sail the seas, never being confident if he will return. The vocals and instrumental are just gorgeous.

My 3 year old son quietly singing “you are my sunshine” to me unprompted (a song I have sung to him since he was born.)

Diamonds and Rust - Joan Baez

The Mother - Brandi Carlile
Constant Craving by k.d. lang.   Oh so sublime!
Chris Cornell's cover of "Nothing compares 2 U" (the SiriusXM version) the emotion he puts into that song haunts me in the best way possible
andrea bocelli con te partiro
Mr. Blue Sky
Victoria 2 countryside theme
Colin Hay- I just don’t think I’ll ever get over you
Entangled by genesis is up there
Where the hood at - DMX
Crazy Mary - pearl jam & Victoria Williams

So sad.

https://youtu.be/Tm8LGxTLtQk
Escape is calling by Sleep theatre, Hymn to Nemesis, and Immigrant song by Karen Q. and Trent Rezner
 "Of love and life - Caamp" 


"Tear - Red Hot Chili Peppers"


Two different types of beautiful. 


One for what could be. One for what has been lost.
How do you even choose?!?
Golden Hour by Kacey Musgraves. The song sounds like butter… I first heard it played at a friend’s funeral and now it brings a bittersweet, melancholic feeling
Bach’s Cello suite No.01 in G major, Prelude for a classic piece.  It is utterly perfect

New school I’m a total sucker for Proud Corazon from the movie Coco

Chopin’s Nocturne in G minor, op. 37 no.1 is also incredibly beautiful. IMHO
Only you by Yaz
Avril 14 by Aphex Twin
Don’t Stop Believing by Journey. Nights in white satin by the Moody blues. My Immortal Evanescence. Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin. November Rain by Guns & Roses….
There are so many, it’s really hard to choose just one.

River Flows In You
The Detroit: Become human Cover of "Hold on just a little while longer", i was going through some though times and it brought tears to my eyes.
Shocked I haven’t seen Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush on here yet.
James Taylor - secret o’ life
Into My Arms - Nick Cave
la petite fille de la mer - Vangelis
Honestly anything by Elton John did me in, my mom was a huge fan of his for forever...but it would have to be "Your Song" by him. She died very suddenly in front of me with that song playing. It's both the most beautiful and haunting song for me. Honestly most Elton songs I can't candle being around but that one can make me inconsolable when I hear it.
Idk, either Moonlight Sonata, or Solas Ane by Samuel Hazo. The second one I listed to recently but its just really beautiful. Conveys thoughts I've never had before.
Up Granville by Peach Pit. Something about it just feels like a friend really close to you just making you feel comfortable.
“The Dreaming Moon” - Magnetic Fields 

[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y10AXYGw3E](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y10AXYGw3E) 

I can listen to this song 20 times in a row and not get tired of it. Just perfect.
Farewell Ballad - Zakk Wylde
The most musical notes I've ever heard was the laughter of my children playing.
This hinges so much on association. Here are a few that take me there every time

A Whiter Shade of Pale - Procol Harum
I Dreamed a Dream - Les Mis
Kokomo - The Beach Boys
September -EWF
Let it be - Blackmill
Mmmbop by Hanson
June Hymn The Decemberists
to build a home the cinematic orchestra
Romeo and Juliet by Dire Straits.

It's beautiful rock ballad.
I Loves You Porgy by Bill Evans
Claire de Lune
Mozarts Requiem.
Ordered Eastward - Hail of Bullets
I don’t know about most beautiful, but 21 years by Toby Mac gotta be the saddest but realist song I ever heard.

The shift near the end stops me in my tracks every time.
Priscilla - Wolven Storm
Toss up between Cuyahoga by REM and Song to the Siren by This Mortal Coil.
serendipity by bts jimin
Autumn by Haste The Day
Debussy - Arabesque
Waking Hour by The Gathering (The TG25: Live at Doornroosje performance is incredible)
Recently, Just Say When by Nothing More
Vivaldis Four Season, its a concert of songs but still is stunningly beautiful. As well as holding childhood significance for myself.
"Meet Me In the Woods' by Lord Huron
If You Could Read My Mind by Gordon Lightfoot comes to mind.
Midnight in Harlem by Tedeschi Trucks
2009 by Mac Miller
Niko and the World Machine
Which Witch - Florence & The Machine. 
I cried like a baby when I listened to it for the first time, I’ve never related to a song more in my life.
Observatory Crest - Captain Beefheart
Black No. 1 - Type O Negative
Opus by Eric Prydz 

Granted I may have rolling and there was a drone light show of an owl flying and then a fireworks show went off during the last 2 minutes and it was the most beautiful song I’d ever heard.
Probably a two way tie between Hotel California by the Eagles and Pour le Monde by Crowded House, such a tough one to pick.  First one has one of the most beautiful guitar solos I've ever heard and the other song created by a music-writing genius.
First time ever I saw your face - Roberta flack
A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square - The Manhattan Transfer
Terror couple kills colonel by Bauhaus
Symphony No. 3 (Górecki)

Aloe Blacc- Momma hold my hand. Acapella version.
Shine on you crazy diamond parts 6-9
Surfs Up - The Beach Boys
Us and Them - Pink Floyd
Carol Inishcurry.  I couldn't find a version completely as Gaeilge, but here's an anglicized one for you.  The Irish words are more a song of gratitude to Mary, for all she suffered through that long journey and in giving birth.  It refers to the greatest gift she brought us "mac mhuirra og" (Mary's little son.)

Breaking of the fellowship from lord of the rings by Howard Shore
I don't know where or when I found it but I always love listening to Lullaby of the Takeda
Circa survive - nesting dolls 
Anthony green and his wife were addicted to herion this is the beauty that came out of his struggle with his wife
If You Could Read my Mind by Gordon Lightfoot. Not the only one, everyone in the comments section talks about how it's made them cry the first time it was played on the radio in the 70s.
Hopeless by Mindset Evolution. Guitar is on point.
Pavane, Op.50, by Gabriel Faure
A song called [Exaelitus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x847Ev0Y_fs) composed by Yoko Kanno (whom you may know from various anime OSTs) with vocals by Origa (frequent partner of Yoko's who sadly passed away in 2015). The funny thing about this song is I believe it was originally intended to be used for a Lexus car commercial, although I'm not sure if that ever came to fruition since I've never found the alleged commercial. In any case, I've never found a song that quite evokes the emotions this one does. It really makes you feel larger than life.
[Moondog- Pastoral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMyjoYGGlNw)

Reminds me of the child/baby music from the Fallout 3 intro. Has a very blissful and innocent sound.
Some songs by Deftones.
Cody Fry's version of Eleanor Rigby is wonderful.
Red rabbits by the shins
Recuerdos del Alhambra by Francisco tarrega

[I’d Like to Walk Around in Your Mind Someday](https://youtu.be/82xcICYq11Y) by Vashti Bunyan
worlds by porter robinson  

not just a single song but one single album meant to be listened to in order. the whole album is damn near perfection. if you really want to boil it down to single songs then id say "divinity" "sad machine" and "goodbye to a world" are the real bangers of the album.  

but seriously, give the album a try.
It's On Us by AJR or I See You by Missio
Hymn of the Cherubim by Tchaikovsky.
Canon in D

2. Aisatsana - Aphex Twin (listen all the way through)

Siobhan Miller's version of Ramblin Rover takes second.

In no particular order, The Longest Johns-Retirement Song; The Ronettes-Be My Baby; Glass Animals-Youth; The Shins-Simple Song; Noah and the Whale-5 Years Time or L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
Send in the Clowns by Stephen Soundheim. Choose a version. Anyone. Period. Though, Judy Collins…
Carl Orff - O Fortuna
Seven Years old by Lukas Graham. The song makes me so emotional and makes me look back on my past actions and what I wanna do in the future.
Buenos Tardes Amigo-Ween
Celery by Buckethead
It shifts all the time but any song off loveless will do it sometimes and when you sleep take the cake tho, constellations by duster is amazing it’s subdued but so beautiful any Black Country new road song specifically track x snow globes and Concorde
Songbird - Fleetwood Mac. I saw John McVie interviewed; talking about how he and Mick Fleetwood watched Christine McVie playing it for the first time. All they could do was stand quietly with tears rolling down their faces.
Into My Arms - Nick Cave and the Bad Scenes  


A beautiful and poetic song about loss and sorrow. It makes sad but at the same time offers hope
"Define Dancing" from the movie Wall-E

Followed closely by "Forbidden Friendship" from the movie How to Train Your Dragon
Jungleland by Bruce Springsteen. That music at the beginning just tell you there is story coming.
[13 Angels Standing Guard 'Round The Side Of Your Bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzToCCdbqIE)

Runaway bu Galantis, absolutely amazing.
[Rainy Night In Georgia - Brook Benton](https://youtu.be/bDRbF80NKDU)
Anybody want to argue that all the classical compositions in here aren't songs because by definition a song is sung, so it would be at least partially a vocal piece of music?
Kiran Ahluwalia - Teray Darsan
just you and i - tom walker
This song is a song in Spanish but “no se tu” by Luis Miguel always just gets me in this deep other mood
Stan, by Eminem and Elton John (not dido).

Hearing the normal song accompanied by Elton’s piano is a masterpiece, it gives me goosebumps every single time in the 3rd verse.
Locryn, keeper of the void. Alex roe is a master. Check out his channel
Friends Make Garbage - Low Roar

Chevaliers De Sangreal - Hans Zimmer
Killing me softly by fugees, lauren hills voice is it. Also somewhere over the rainbow by brother iz

Blinding lights by weeknd
Easy Way Out

Low Roar
I really like Setsuna’s cover of white album
Nimrod from Enigma Variations - Edward Elgar
Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters by Elton John.

One of his finest I reckon
Its really difficult, so many songs I find beautiful are caught up in whatever I have them attached to. Perhaps a typical answer but offhandedly Hurt by Johnny Cash and Nine Inch nails. Being the same song but hits so differently.
Flaws and Sins by Juice WRLD, super sweet song and how you’d want your romantic partner to view you, give it a listen, highly reccomend, sadly didn’t listen to much of the album while he was alive
Angels like you by Miley Cyrus
Post-War, M. Ward
the songs that have emotionally moved me are

'Hero and Leander' and 'Awaiting You'

They're from "myths and hymns", a song cycle by Adam Guettel.

His work  is pretty much underrated but his music just has a way of giving you an emotional experience.

'Where You Are' and 'Home To Stay' by Josh Groban

'Think Of Laura' and 'Sailing' by Christopher Cross

'Call the Man' and 'Fly' by Celine Dion

'My Valentine' by Martina McBride

'Don't Wanna Miss A Thing' by Aerosmith
Panda Rosa super underrated but makes beautiful music, neo China view is beautiful art
Seesaw by Jamie XX or maybe Cloudbusting by Kate Bush
Stranded Lullaby by Miracle Musical. The "ghost" demo is even better :)
If I had to make a choice it would be either "[Cornfield Chase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE-qxNVoUSo)" or "[S.T.A.Y.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4o0qnSeVQQ)" on the Interstellar soundtrack. Hans Zimmer really did a wonder on that whole soundtrack.

Runner up would be Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli doing [Time to say Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L_yCwFD6Jo)

Grandma- Nier Replicant
Duvet by boa or Dreams by Fleetwood Mac
‘Time Stands Still’ - Rush

It’s about being present in the moment and more importantly, being present with your with loved ones.  It’s especially touching for me because I have a 3 year old son and a one year old daughter who’s existences seem to accelerate time somehow (weird).

When my son was born I enjoyed him in his infancy, but I did occasionally and foolishly wish he was just a little older, and just had a little more personality, and again- foolishly looked forward to what we would do when he was older, rather then focusing on the ‘then and now’. Couple that with the hours I worked the 1st year of his life and it finally hit me that I missed out.  I was robbed, and I was the robber.  I remember being at work, crying in a bathroom because my wife sent me a photo of him from 3 months prior, and I didn’t remember him looking like he did in the photo. I realized I either wished away or wasn’t there for my sons first year with us. And it was my own damn fault. 

A short while later I came across this song and boy did I feel it.  It became my anthem for a little while and as a bonus, little man loved it too!  I try to listen to this song as little as possible, so it always keeps its impact!

Anyways, I have much more time for my wife and kids now, and make it a point to enjoy them exactly where they are each and everyday.  Plus Rush is the greatest band of all time so that helps make it that most beautiful song I ever did hear!

I fell in love with Kintsugi by Roch the first time I heard it. The lyrics struck a deep chord in me, had full body chills and knew instantly that I would need a specific lyric tattooed on me. I proudly wear "Are we all together lovingly out of place?" under my collarbones.
Kimi No Kioku from Persona 3, that hit me in the soul and still does to this day
"The Darkness" by Scarypoolparty. 
There's two main versions and one is heavy on string instruments and they're just both so perfect.

You are a memory - message to bears
O Magnum Mysterium - Westminstrel Cathedral Choir
This thread desperately requires a bot to provide links because almost *nobody* fuckin' bothered.
Also! First Time Ever I Saw Your Face by Roberta Flack
You Have Been Loved by George Michael. Written and released when he was DEEEEP in the closet, when AIDS was still a very big conversation and a very big fear for gay people. About the man he'd just lost to AIDS, and the man's mother, and how useless religion is.
Hurt by Johnny cash- very soothing

Sunshine-Onerepublic (Must listen!)
Me or Us- Young Thug
Mary by Big Thief

Not a romantic love song, but a platonic one, for old friends and the memories with them.
"Wedding Day" by Casting Crowns brought me to tears...great song

O Mio Babbino Caro  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qsT6-P-pkM
Old pine by Ben Howard
For a long time, no piece of media could get me to cry. Movies, TV shows, books, music, all of it was fiction to me and therefor did nothing.

Then I listened to Everywhere at the End of Time.

I listened to the entire album without breaks, and when I got to the very end, those last 5 minutes made me sob. It hit me harder than anything else had before.
Honestly, Moonlight Sonata does it for me. I’m not even that big of a classical lover, but there’s something so beautiful and haunting in that song.
Aphex Twin - Rhubarb
Watermelon in Easter Hay by Frank Zappa.
D’Angelo - Untitled (How Does It Feel)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11sUyEWB-oM
One of my bandmates wrote a song called Winter Bouquet for a holiday EP we did a couple years ago. It's so warm and comforting, but cold and sad at the same time. One of the best songs I've ever heard period
waiting in the weeds - Eagles
Stay - Rihanna
There’s a melancholic but hopeful beauty to the acoustic version of *Everlong* by The Foo Fighters. Same goes for *Plush* by Stone Temple Pilots. 

Also, as weird as it may seem for people who don’t listen to or even care for death metal, I was so blown away by the song *O Father, O Satan, O Sun* by Behemoth. From the intro baseline on, it’s an incredible piece of music. The final minute or so of the song is especially ethereal and beautiful.
Miracles by Jefferson Starship
Save tonight - eagle eye cherry
I really like May it Be by Enya for the Lord of the Rings soundtrack. In fact, most of that score is beautifully done
The Garden-Rush
Farewell by Apocalyptica.  Not well know, but one of the most amazing things I've heard.
*I See The Light* from *Tangled*. Simple, elegant, touching.
Bless the broken road - Rascal Flatts
In Our Bedroom After The War, by the band Stars. Nothing else I've ever listened to comes even remotely close.
Suite: Judy Blue Eyes

“Something inside is telling me that I've got your secret

Are you still listening?

Fear is the lock and laughter the key to your heart

And I love you

I am yours, you are mine, you are what you are

You make it hard”
Into the mystic by Van Morrison
I Guess We’ll Forget the Sound by Bodies of Water
I love the solemness of Mad World - Gary Jules
Green Fields of France by The High Kings
I wish I could share them, I can't, but it's a tie between two songs my best friend wrote. "In Your Life" and "BC" (I can't remember how to spell the title of the second one as it's in Irish Gaelic but it means "Hello, Fate"). She's recorded the first one but I don't think she'd be comfortable with me sharing it, sadly. :(
This is from a now disbanded band. Used to listen to them a lot back in high school. They are from Brazil and the vocalist has this angelic voice!

The Rainbow Connection
Song by Jim Henson
Sung by Kermit the Frog

Why are there so many
Songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side
Rainbow's are visions
But only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some Choose to believe it
But I know they're wrong wait and see
Someday we'll find it
The Rainbow Connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
Who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it
Look what it's done so far
What's so amazing
That keeps us star gazing
And what do we think we might see
Someday we'll find it
That Rainbow Connection
The lovers the dreamers and me
All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic
Have you been half asleep
And have you heard voices
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that call's the young sailors
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
Its something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it
The Rainbow Connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

Pyramid Song - Radiohead.  If this song doesn't make your heart swell, call the coroner cause you're dead inside.  I mean its just perfect, serene, mysterious bliss.  I listened to it a lot way back playing Zelda twilight princess, so the two are inextricably linked in my mind.
On The Blue Danube- Strauss
(They long to be) close to you by the carpenters, remembers me of a beautiful soul I met once, gets me everytime
Friday - Carly Rae Jepsen
The sun the moon the stars- aether realm. 

It's metal and 20minutes long but I wish I could get everyone to give it a shot. It's like poetry and the words while somewhat sparse are really enrapturing and powerful.
Holocene - Bon Iver
The Wolven Storm, from The Witcher 3.
Sarah McLachlan - Last Dance

Lonely Shepherd - Gheorghe Zamfir.   Edit: River Flows in You - Yiruma, Until the Last Moment - Yanni, and Ecstasy of Gold - Ennio Morricone also deserve to be here.

Worried List - Blue October

Thank You - Led Zeppelin

You and I by Jacob Collier
Kiss of Life - Sade

Sounds dumb, but [Kate Bush's song about Wuthering Heights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk-4lXLM34g). She sings it from the point of view of the ghost of Cathy, come to the window of Heathcliff to beg to finally be let in by him, after a lifetime of wronging each other despite their deep love. If you've read the book, you understand that what happens next is Heathcliff opens the window, then freezes to death that night - the book ends with his ghost embracing Cathy's, finally undoing a tragic life spent hating each other for loving each other. Kate Bush's melody is haunting, and her interpretive dancing captures the idea of a ghost or a corpse desperately reaching out to a lover. Honestly the only song to ever make my heart hurt. I always end up watching it after a breakup, and weeping.

My Sweet Lord by George Harrison
Seven Bridges Road - Iain Matthews
As by Stevie Wonder. Stunning.
Sword Art Online anime’s “Swordland”
It’s a pretty new song but J’s Lullaby has got to be on my top ten. It’s incredibly beautiful and has a way of melting away all of my anxiety
Hoist the colors.
Drugs you should try it - Travis Scott
Clair De Lune, it's like magic to my ears every time I hear it.
Bach's Air on G string is beautiful
Every song made by the band Whirr
Willie Nelson’s cover of the scientist and waterloo sunset by the kinks.
i recently subbed in with one of my university’s non-major orchestras to play clarinet with them! one piece they did was strings only but it went right into a piece with winds so we had to just stay on while they played it. it was just such an amazing performance with SO much emotion from the conductor! getting to witness it while sitting on stage and being able to see his face while performing was amazing, i thought it was one of the most magical moments of music i’ve ever experienced. the piece was the second movement from grieg’s peer gynt suite, called the death of åse
The Stable Song by Gregory Alan Isakov
“When it’s Time” - Green Day
Joni Mitchells' "court& spark" whole album.
Julep, Punch Brothers.
I've heard a lot of beautiful songs, but none better than Simon & Garfunkel's original studio recording of *Bridge over Troubled Water*.  

Roberta Flack's version of *The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face* is a very close runner-up.
The truth- Jason Aldean
Andromeda from Weyes Blood
Courage by Superchick. Makes me bawl every time because it’s so relatable.
“Last in Love” by Nicolette Larson is a gem.
I don't remember the name of it or its composer, unfortunately, but it was a song composed entirely a cappella by a choir director from some university in Southern California. I heard it when at said university for a choir competition when I was in high school. He told the story of what inspired the song and what he was trying to impart on the audience with it and everyone around me was goofing off and I was just sitting there enraptured. I can't even properly remember the exact details of the story, but I have a fairly strong impression it had to do with a mother losing a child in a bombing in Vietnam?? I remember being able to visualize the story and just coming back to reality with tears streaming down my face. It was so amazing that someone could compose something that intricate and that the human voice could mimic some sounds perfectly in a beautiful arrangement.
Samwise the Brave - Howard Shore (from The Two Towers)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXaJI0L562k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXaJI0L562k)
I’ve always been quite partial to Ill Follow You Into the Dark.
'Blessed Be' by Spiritbox. I don't even really know why, everything about that song is just so beautiful to me, and it's not even their best one, or my favourite.
[Somewhere over the Rainbow ](https://youtu.be/V1bFr2SWP1I)
Springtime can kill you - Jolie Holland the daytrotter sessions
Hallelujah
Beyond - Leon Bridges 
His voice is amazing, it’s such a sweet song. It took me a few listens before I actually listened to the lyrics but it definitely made me cry a little, though I was definitely PMSing so..

2) Things I Can’t Do For You (rough translation) by Park Hyo Shin

Kanojo no Modern by GLAY
The orchestral instrumental version
The Prayer.  It was originally sang by Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli.  But the best version in my opinion is with Charlotte Church and Josh Groban.  [Link here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBDlqIISWko)
Lateralus - tool. Although I feel like most people wouldn’t really correlate the heavier sound as something “beautiful,” I feel that the lyrics and instrumentals could make the song be considered as such. One of my favorites.
You Missed My Heart by Phoebe Bridgers or These Days by Nico
Layla. Derek & the Dominoes..
Dinosaur by ol Hank Williams
Sextape by Deftones

Ctrl + f my favorite composers, 0 results

Y'all have no class. 

No Mahler?? My friends, you haven't heard classical music until you've heard Mahler. Here's his most famous work: [Adagietto from Symphony no. 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AuSs55t64)

Brahms has to be one of the most beloved composer by classical musicians. Here's one of my favorites: [Piano Quartet No. 3 3rd movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkSDzDgX04Q)

3 pieces in particular get mentioned in every thread: Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, Debussy's Clair de Lune, and Chopin's Nocturne in Eb. 

While the nocturne is nice, here are two of Chopin's best works, considered by most to be his finest masterpieces: [Ballade no. 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tmQSWuYwrI) and [Sonata no. 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=179ZxHjD36U)

I'd also like to share this one by Beethoven that you may not have heard unless you are a pianist: [Piano Concerto no. 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2360gtWBFeA)

And here's some Debussy. Also infamous, but maybe less so than Clair de Lune: [Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9iDOt2WbjY)

I have more favorite composers but this list should be good for now. PM for suggestions.
Ave Maria by Schubert 
Specifically [this one](https://youtu.be/2H5rusicEnc) there’s something so divine about it I can’t even explain
Better the Mask by Japanese Breakfast
Honey Pain - Koe Wetzel
A Boy And a Girl by Eric Whitacre
Black by Pearl Jam.
In your arms - sunbeam sound machine. I want to die to this song
Welcome to the show by DPR IAN
Tocatta, from Fresh Aire 3 by Mannheim Steamroller. Every time I put it on, i stop what I’m doing to just listen.
We are Bulletproof
You guys know that deep down we all know it's Never Gonna Give You Up
Do You Hear What I Hear - King & Country. Its more of a seasonal song, but its great nontheless.
If you’ve never listened to Dearly Beloved you’re missing out! Don’t sleep on video game music!
Rules of Beautiful by Jacob Whitesides
One that comes to mind is Light On - Maggie Rogers. Her voice is just beautiful. The song is so  freeing to me.
Speak To Me by Amy Lee, beautiful but also tragic as it's about the spirit of a dead woman communicating with her child from beyond the grave.
“Buddy” by Willie Nelson. When my son was just a baby I’d cradle him in my arms before putting him to sleep while it played. Some of the happiest moments of my life.
Something to be proud of by Montgomery Gentry always makes me tear up. I’m not a huge country fan, but I first heard it when I was in middle school and I fucking love it
Power of Sound - Ace

A song I'm willing to bet not many people know of. It's one of those songs that speaks to me and while I'll give an honorable mention to Canon in D, Power of Sound strikes me where no other song has struck before.
Nocturne in C sharp minor - Chopin
Girl From the North Country, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash. I always stop what I'm doing and listen because it makes me think of my mom.
Hurt sung by Johnny Cash. 

Fake plastic trees by Radio head

The nurse who loved me by A perfect circle. 

Stinkfist by Tool.
“Rocket For The Girl” by Everclear. Some very bittersweet memories with that song, but it’s just beautiful to me.
Ni Yao De Ai - Penny Tai (I don't speak the language but something about the music is moving)
If - Bread
I Will Always Love You by Whitney Houston written by Dolly Parton
Lady May - Tyler Childers
How Great Thou Art - Home Free

As We Go Along - The Monkees

The Only Living Boy in New York - Simon and Garfunkel

We Don’t Live Here No More - John Denver

Live Or Die (Hold Me Like a Child) - The Bee Gees

There are so many, but I think How Great Thou Art wins.  I honestly hated that hymn until I heard Home Fred’s version.  Changed my life.
Orchid by Black Sabbath, it makes it even more amazing and beautiful song knowing Black Sabbath and that they have a very dark morbid sound and to have Tony come out with this absolute masterpiece is almost a symbol of finding beauty in the darkest places and times
You’re the most beautiful song
Blade Runner Blues
Sacrifices By Dreamville. Just makes me feel some type of way.
Alleluia by Randall Thompson
Make Someone Happy - Jimmy Durante

Ben Platt singing River by Joni Mitchell in The Politician
Go or go ahead by Rufus Wainwright
Righteous - Juice WRLD
[Awaken by Yes.](https://youtu.be/59feSG8U5EQ)

The lyrics, the orchestration, the arrangement, and the organ solo in the middle is amazing. Yeah, it's like 20 min long, but I love that.

For me, it's like a song written by God. I cry most times I hear it, to be honest. That crescendo is fucking unreal and maybe the greatest crescendo ever, regardless of genre. A gift to music and humanity, for all time.

It also happens to be Jon Anderson's favorite Yes song.

I think of it as a musical representation of a spiritual awakening, with each section illustrating another aspect of the process, complexity, chaos, then silence, and a heartbeat inside that silence, and then growth into the majesty and the closing return to silence again.
Emil (Sacrifice) - from the Nier Replicant soundtrack
Nights by Frank Ocean
New Slang - The Shins
It's super hard to choose because I've heard alot, but if I absolutely had to choose one:

Main Actor - Minami

It's a Japanese song, but even without understanding it her singing is just amazing. If you do look up the lyrics on YouTube (turn on captions in her music video), the lyrics of the song just make it even better.
Mexican seafood
Honeybee - Steam Powered Giraffe and
More Than Words - Extreme
Cemetery gates - Pantera
On the turning away - pink floyd
Lake Shore Drive- Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah
Ball Park Music - Cherub. Absolutely beautiful song about changing and becoming a better person.
In a Graveyard by Rufus Wainwright
What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong.

Think about it, as a black guy he couldn't go through the front door of a restaurant, yet that's the song he writes.
A Gallant Gentleman by We Lost the Sea.
Too many to choose from. If I had to pick a genre, I'd say Finnish Christmas songs. Not the modern ones.
Sia - My Love
Caves and embers
Happier Than Ever- Billie Eilish
Helpless by Neil Young, especially Molly Tuttle's cover of it.
Wait for the moment - Vulfpeck
 Beyond The Hourglass by I Am Ghost
Very few songs bring me to tears on the first listen. But here's a couple of them:

Plumb - In My Arms

Darren Hayes - Bloodstained Heart

Darren Criss - Cough Syrup

Brian Justin Crum - Creep
[Babylon - David Gray ](https://youtu.be/cGvsONUqLgg)
Psalm 151 by Ezra furman or God Lifts Up the Lowly (also by Ezra furman) not everyone’s cup of tea, but something about it is just stunning. The lyrics, the sound, everything. The second one’s strings sound like a heartbeat and someone breathing.
Riviera Paradise - Stevie Ray Vaughan
Danzón No. 2 composed by Arturo Márquez
Not exactly a song more of an instrumental, but I used to play A quiet life theme song by Marco Beltrami. It’s an instrumental from the movie A quiet place, it’s really soothing.
[Over My Head](https://youtu.be/Tc9jM9DVQcA) by Alabama Shakes

[The Last of My Kind](https://youtu.be/YIkJxps4JFI) by Jason Isbell

[Nessun Dorma](https://youtu.be/cWc7vYjgnTs) sung by Pavarotti

Apotheosis - Austin Wintory (Journey OST)
Fever to the form - Nick Mulvey
Come together - Primal Scream
HAIM FUBT
Rhubarb by Aphex Twin.  Literally have just bawled to it.  Definitely evokes a plethora of uncomfortable yet calming emotions.
Hallelujah
Belles by Vetiver
Saturn by Sleeping At Last
Creature - half alive

Tightrope walker - Ayla Nereo

Dear fellow traveler - Sea Wolf
Introduction to the snow off of Hawaii part 2
Radio protector by 65daysofstatic.

This genre of music is insane
This is kind of a lame pick but Austin Wintory - I Was Born for This. It's from the video game Journey but it's amazing.
Does VGM count? If so, “Beyond the Sky” from Xenoblade.
If not, I’d say “She’s Always a Woman” by Billy Joel
Mad World and Rainbow Connection are two of my favorites.
90210
Runaway by Kanye West. Fucking beautiful.
My vote goes for [Can I Catch Fire?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-32zpnNTXo) by Max Sharam.

Also, most of the songs from Stevie Wonder's *Songs in the Key of Life*.
“Hard Edges” - Chris Knight

#1 ass kicker right here folks. It’s sad as fuck but it’s some of the most beautiful country/western writing to me.  There is a more simple demo like version that hits the hardest.

Slowly spinning round and round
In the smoke and the smell of rye
She takes off all her clothes
So they don't see down in her eyes

The scarlet rouge and blue tattoos
Are only painted on
But underneath the dark drumbeat
A ballerina dances on
The Soviet National Anthem
Vicarious - Tool everything I want in a song and more
Handsome Boy Modeling School - The Truth 

One of my all time favorite.
Bones in the ocean - The longest johns. I was singing along to it one day I started crying without realizing it. No other song has done that to me
Saturn by Sleeping at Last
Von by Yoko Kanno and Arnor Dan
Rivers and Roads by the Head and the Heart
Ghost Story by Sting. Generally, he’s a tool. But it’s a beautiful song.
Walk in the Park by Beach House made me cry the first time I listened to it. First song to do that to me!
Whimsical-Crave Bothers NCS
Danny Boy (Johnny Cash version)
Probably a tie between Just Like Heaven and A Letter to Elise, both by The Cure. A Letter to Elise is more tragically beautiful and everything in that song works amazingly well. Just Like Heaven, well, that song speaks for itself. Robert Smith is a musical genius and one of the greatest of all time.
Meet me in the city - Junior Kimbrough
Old pine - Ben Howard 
The wind - cat stevens 
Cherry wine - Hoozier
This does it for me:

Impossible Germany by Wilco
Kissing You- Desirée
Knocking on heaven's door - RAIGN

Eva Cassidy’s cover of anything, really.
I recently started listening to metal and heavy metal. I didn't realize how much beauty and emotion I was missing.

Hold On To Memories by Disturbed
Wrong Side of Heaven by Five Finger Death Punch
How Did You Love by Shinedown
Van Morrison- have i told you lately 

such
 a beautiful song.
Taylor Swift has some contenders that deserve to be in the conversation. For anyone rolling their eyes in disbelief, don’t judge her by the songs you hear on the radio, her most beautiful songs aren’t mass appealing enough to be on the radio.

Belong by Cary Brothers is also up there for me.
Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639 by Johann Sebastian Bach.
Never going back again. Fleetwood Mac.
Maging Sino Ka Man
The Hamster Dance

Hadaka no Yuusha by Vaundy
So many great options here! I’m adding the live version of “You Got Me” by the Roots mostly because of the lovely and talented Miss Jill Scott’s vocals at the end of the song. I get goosebumps every time.
Red Army Choir - Varchavianka
Kusanagi by Odesza
always, i'll care by Jeremy Zucker
Maya Singh - Prinzessin (princess). I only have that one song of her, and it has a low chance to pop up, but it makes me happy every time.
for the context of the past few years the most memorable beautiful song is the song “Hope” by “Blood Orange” as its something I showed to a girl I was in love with. Seasons change but the trees remain I suppose.
City and colour- we found each other in the dark

[Samuel Barber - Agnus Dei](https://youtu.be/c2CvxIAFqRo)

It’s his own setting of his Adagio for Strings for mixed choir. This particular recording is my favorite. Enjoy.

Sit, eyes closed, breathe deeply, and listen actively. It will enthrall you.

Finally, I have to be that asshole and say that most of the pieces of music mentioned in this thread are not songs, technically. They are pieces of music. A song is a piece of music that is sung by a singer.
Total Eclipse of the Heart
Sea of Love - Cat Power
Lover, You Should’ve Come Over by Jeff Buckley
Ordinary World

You'll See by Modest Mouse.
Ára bátur by Sigur Rós.
"Freedom" by Elayna Boynton from the Django soundtrack. I can listen to it a million times and it still makes my skin crawl with goosebumps.

The fact that audio can almost force you to move and give you physical sensations is what I love most about music.

Kind of related to that second part, the "try not to headbang challenge" is a good example of how it can affect you physically. It's a beautiful thing.
"Song to the Siren" - This Mortal Coil
Young and Beautiful - Lana Del Rey
*Wings for Marie [I](https://youtu.be/BNTo34xOwoM) & [II](https://youtu.be/qJq9y9xPKWs)* by Tool.

Hope to Die has such wonderful buildups and is gut wrenching. 

No Glory in the West is so soft and lyrically beautiful too
Soleil by Yoshie Nakano. First time I heard it a feeling of nostalgia came to me and made me cry. Best experience I’ve had with music in my whole life

Ave Maria.
Your Guardian Angel by The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus

Love that song.

I've never been one to be affected by a song but this, thus is the only song that's ever made me sad completely on its own.
Porcelina of the Vast Ocean - Smashing Pumpkins
Fade Into You by Mazzy Star. Greatest song ever made imo.
“This Will End” and “Hello My Old Heart” by The Oh Hellos. A bit more on the depressing side but beautiful nonetheless.

“Dheiric Mi Moch Madainn Cheothar” (or some spelling variant thereof) by Julie Fowlis

“Could You Believe” by Twila Paris 

“Veni, Veni Emmanuel.” Not sure who sings the arrangement I typically listen to, but it’s a female vocalist and she does a great job.

experience ludovico einaudi. Shit you not, I cried the first time I heard it at a color guard competition.
Long Season by Fishmans 26.12.1998 Live Version

It holds a lot of emotional weight for me, the lyrics, the atmosphere, more than 40 minutes of flawless performance, the lady with the violin, and hearing the piano returning after long segments, and the fact that this was meant to be their last concert, as one of them was leaving the band. It turned out to be their last concert, because months later Shinji Sato, the vocalista, died.

I listen to Long Season over and over again and always makes me cry. It's my favorite song and will probably forever be.
Toss up between Bon Iver-Skinny Love and Lauv-Reforget

Au5, Jeto & Cristina Soto - Melt

It's just a wonderful song that balances vocal priority and dubstep sound design, with no hints of deviating away from its music theory.

The lyrics may be simple but it conveys the message well, the sound design blends into the emotion trying to portray by the lyrics. This song has got to be one of the most well-thought songs in modern bass music.
Orbital - Halcyon On and On
River-Leon Bridges
The soundtrack to the “The Mission” movie.
after much thought.. 3 rounds and a sound - blind pilot

For me this is kind of a random one but the Corinthians anthem. Whenever I hear it I remember how when we used to live in Brasil, my grandma would come over and we’d watch their games every time there was one. Some of my best memories right there
The Lighthouse's Tale by Nickel Creek. I've probably listened to it 500 times and I still cry each time.
Le Festin off the ratatouille soundtrack…don’t know what she’s singing about but it has such a happy, yet melancholy melody—-plus I’m biased because it’s tied to great memories watching that movie over and over with my kids!
Boris - Flood. Specifically the 7-8 minutes leading up to Flood III and everything after.
Follow you to Virgie
Shostakovich, The Gadfly Suite, Romance
Hide and Seek by Imogen Heap.
Immunity by Jon Hopkins gives me waves of chills down my back. Most songs don't affect me physiologically like that. And then Stars and Chimneys by Kalaido has an absolutely stunning melody half way though.

I haven't heard a whole lot in my lifespan so far but my favorite song is "Coming of Age" by Blondes. it feels like how you think the 1990's were if you never lived through them.
The version of Scarborough Fair by Simon & Garfunkel that features Andy Williams makes me cry every time I hear it. It just has some of the most pure, beautiful singing I’ve ever heard

Cocktales - Too $hort

God only knows by the beach boys
“Gracias a la vida” by Mercedes Sosa. I had been taking Spanish in college for a couple years when a friend played me this song. It was the first song I understood in a language other than what I’d been raised with, and the awe of the worlds left undiscovered just overwhelmed me. Completely appropriate that the song translates to, “Thanks to Life” because it was a beautiful discovery that life gave me well into my thirties. I heard it once said that you don’t truly understand a language until you understand it’s poetry, and even if it was entry level, “Gracias a la vida” opened me to feeling that for the first time. It is a beautiful moment and i will remember it always.

Jean-Jacques Goldman - Comme toi. His voice is so soothing, relaxing, gentle and beautiful, almost like an angel's voice and the melody is so delightful. The downside is that if you understand french or even if you don't, if you look up what he actually sings about, it's sad as fuck...
Tchaikovsky Symphony 5, movement 2. Not technically a song but absolutely stunning.
Into the west - Annie lennox
I am the antichrist to you - kishi bashi

You don't need to understand a word of it to feel what its meaning.
Blood in the Wine by AURORA. It was only released last night but it was a revelatory experience
Specifically this rendition of the song: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mulxxoAKf20&t=3s&ab\_channel=BenPoulsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mulxxoAKf20&t=3s&ab_channel=BenPoulsen)

I've always hated Gospel, but that rendition of "Down to the river to pray" is genuinely beautiful.

Home by Foo Fighters
River of Deceit by Mad Season. Layne Staleys best song IMO.

O Magnum Mysterium by Morten Lauridsen. Was the song that finally convinced me to join choir.

i swear, these guys put crack in their music. it’s genuinely some of the greatest stuff i’ve ever heard
Fire and Rain - James Taylor


Amsterdam - Coldplay
Probably Afterglow by Ed Sheeran. He's just so incredible at creating thoughtful, simplistic acoustic music that speaks to the heart.
The Sound of Silence. Simon can write some beautiful lyrics!

Too many to choose from truthfully. Currently hooked on city nights by DRYVE and fatherdude.
Irish Angel - Jonny Lang
Innerbloom - Rufus du Sol
“The Stable Song” - Gregory Alan Isakov
October - Eric Whitacre 

It makes my soul nostalgic for a moment in time one autumn in my teenaged years. Just pure emotion.
Oh boy, here we go.

Time We Had by The Motherhips always hits a specific little heartstring for me. I always go to a specific point in my life, like a span of a couple hours tops, in what was one of the worst times I ever had.

San Luis by Gregory Alan Isakov. 

Life by The Drop by The Stevie Ray Vaughan

Held by Natalie Grant. “This hand is bitterness. We want to taste it and let the Hatred know our sorrows, but the wise hand opens slowly to lillies of the valley and tomorrows.”

Sound of Silence is one of my favorites of all time.

Joyner Lucas has some big hitters. I think I’m Sorry is tragically brilliant and Ross Capichonni is amazing prose in music.

Canon in D by Pachelbel is iconic

Night we Met by Lord Huron

You and Me by Penny and The Quarters is lo-fi and lovely but the whole story behind the making is kind of haunting.

The entire Rumors album by Fleetwood Mac. Dreams is dipped in gold.

GOSPEL MUSIC. Whether or not your religious to hear a choir of talented singers praise as if their very souls depend on it, the sound of human voices rejoicing? Da-yum. The Fighting Temptations soundtrack is all Gospel with Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter. Now that’s it.

There’s thousands of suggestions I got. I’m just getting warmed up.
On the Light by Portico Quartet. Best nu-jazz I've heard in a while
Re: Stacks - Bon Iver

Feeling yourself disintegrate - The Flaming Lips
I’m a sucker for Afternoon on a Hill

But in more modern tastes, Yubikiri-Genman (Special Edit) by Mili and No Such Thing/Satellite Call by Sarah Bareilles were both very pretty.

It’s got to be Rachmaninoff’s 2nd Piano Concerto. That piece is the gateway drug to classical music
[Hallelujah](https://youtu.be/P_NpxTWbovE) sung by K.D. Lang (this song has been covered soooo many times by soooo many people there are lots of opinions on this but I will maintain this is the best version).

Beautiful song.  Originally composed and sung by Leonard Cohen.

Glósóli by Sigur Ros
Rex's Blues by Townes Van Zandt
Shine On You Crazy Diamond by Pink Floyd
Serenade to Music by Ralph Vaughn Williams. Do the Orchestral version only. When it debuted in his local theater, there was not a dry eye in the audience, it was that beautiful. My local KDFC Classical station gave me that introduction and I’ve been absolutely hooked. Longer piece but it’s so so so worth it.
My hump - Fergie



Edit: Fergie*
Immaterial - SOPHIE
Eva Cassidy, Songbird. Such a tragic story, she passed away from cancer just as her career was taking off. Her voice is stunningly beautiful. If you have never listened to her music, do yourself a favour.
"If I Could" by Regina Belle. According to my mother, as a baby, when that song came on the radio, I'd sit completely still and just listen. Even as an adult, I get a little choked up when I listen to it.
Down To the River to Pray - Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?
Pearl Jam - Sirens

Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst - Kendrick Lamar
Peru. Fireboy
I have to mention Reunion - Anoushka Shankar.

It's impossible not to feel relief and joy when listening.

I'll be thinking about this question and this thread for weeks.
Kamado tanjiro no uta
Nothing else matters-  Metalica
Between the Bars, Elliott Smith
Whiskey lullaby comes to mind. Its so beautiful.

Though the most beautiful song I have ever heard was a cover of hallelujah by an A capella group from my university. It was performed in a beautiful church and the acoustics were life changing. I wish I had a recording or something but I will just never hear it again
Probably 22 (Over Soon) by Bon Iver. just stunning every single time
Seriously who has the Spotify playlist for this thread ?

Black is the color. Many artists have done it Cara Dillon is my favorite version.
Changes as sung by charles bradley, or OCT 33  by Black Pumas, their song Colors also brings a tear to my eyes. Also Iron Sky by Paolo Nutini. I listen to a lot of Music with large instrumental sections recorded live, and then I buy them on vinyl and blast them on a really big stereo. so some songs that sound plain or basic on a normal set up will sound absolutely drop dead.
High hopes.  Pink Floyd
When I look at you by Miley Cyrus
I'd rather go blind , Etta James
*Virginia* by Tori Amos
Yas - Empty Crown
Made In Heaven by Queen
Live your life ~ Rihanna

Reminds me I’m not the only one with addiction
I love this post, OP. Good job. 

Also, it bothers me intensely that I used to be a person who had go-to lists of songs, categorized by mood, all stored in my head and could have reeled them off for you at the drop of a hat. And I'm sitting here grasping aimlessly around my brain to name even one.
Duet, from Omori

Longer - Dan Fogelberg

Snow - Red Hot Chili Peppers

May Nothing but Happiness Come Through Your Door by Mogwai
Skinny Love - Birdy (cover)
Summer by BROCKHAMPTON
Harley Darling, The Pretty Reckless
It would be a crime to only list one (and near impossible to) but I'm having to restrain myself from linking 30 different songs lol, so I'm just gonna link the ones I narrowed down to:

[Brother - Kodaline](https://youtu.be/Mh8zwBK1obQ)

[Dance with my Demons - Blame My Youth](https://youtu.be/s6cdSXFPHrI)

[King - Lauren Aquilina](https://youtu.be/xywqsEsOY0g)

[Let Go - Frou Frou](https://youtu.be/VvdzKHhgANA)

[Lullaby for a Stormy Night - Vienna Teng](https://youtu.be/Dslen0lIUYA)

[Night Caller - Abandoned & ImfiNoise](https://youtu.be/kLkhKjR9_A8)
Stickerbush Symphony by David Wise
Mayonaise by Smashing Pumpkins
Cubism Dream by Local Natives
Bear - The antlers
Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso Op.28.
[Home](https://youtu.be/u4_MMTJFKaI) by Excision and Dion Timmer. Specifically the original mix. The Spag Heddy remix is great and all (especially if you're boppin) but I don't think it matches the beauty of the original.

It's the purest form of heartbreak, fear, love, joy, and hope. It's not even that deep of a song, lyrically speaking, but the music makes it hit me so much harder. The music is *wholesome* and I can remember my greatest memories when I listen to this song. And that high pitch at the end just gets me everytime. Reminds me why I love the people that I love.
It's very lovely that the world is full of beauty in music. 
This thread makes the soul fly.

As with anyone this an almost impossible question, but I think for me the three most beautiful would be

1) Debussy - Claire de lune
2) The Beatles - Long and winding road
3) Tom Petty - Free falling (if pearly gates really are a thing, I will hear the guitar riff when I arrive)
Modern Marvel - Mo's Def

First 2/3 are just incredibly beautiful to me. Soulful spoken song with amazing inflections over a chill inducing Marvin Gaye sample, capped off by an amazing beat switch and rap to finish it off
I'm on a Hyper Potions craze rn. Try Cozy. Although... people might find Railway Life more beautiful.
Stairway to Heaven, hands down.
"Te para 3"  from  sodastereo (te para 3 means tea for 3 in spanish
The Parts - Manchester Orchestra

If It’s the Beaches - The Avett Brothers

Lark - Angel Olsen

To Live Is To Fly - Townes Van Zandt
Alegria from cirque du soleil
Hauntingly beautiful
Tears from heaven by Eric Clapton
More of a piece than a song, but [Pas de Deux](https://youtu.be/YR5USHu6D6U) from The Nutcracker is always a good answer
The song that blue lady sung in The Fifth Element. Or that Vitas song. Basically the same thing.
Cigarettes & Saints - The Wonder Years
I would probably say Relax from Huxlxy
self control by frank ocean.
Banks --NEED TO BREATHE.  

First time I heard it I was laying down on a beach next to a fire staring at the sky with friends.  One guy introduced it as a beautiful song and asked if we would all be quiet and just listen and while it played. 

I have never felt such peace, complete joy and hope of being what the song speaks of for someone.
Overjoyed - Stevie Wonder

Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You) - Stevie Wonder
To Build. Home - The Cinematic Orchestra
Norah Jones - Don't Know Why
Elton John- The One
It's a song from an anime (Godzilla singular point) - Alapu Upala
Red Swan by Yoshiki ft Hyde
The Poet and the Muse. It’s not the song part that I think is beautiful it is the story that it tells.
“Marry me” theme from pirates of the Caribbean is amazing
[Sketches of Pain](https://youtu.be/t6KuOo9kt6g) by Tears for Fears
Vincent by Don Mclean
I Got a Name by Jim Croce.
How did I forget...my go-to happy song:

- [Israel Kamakawiwo'ole -- 'Over The Rainbow' & 'What A Wonderful World' Medley](https://youtu.be/Z26BvHOD_sg)

Dunno if it is true but I have been told he has Elvis like status in Hawaii.

Martha - Tom Waits

Alison by Slowdive has to be up there
On the nature of daylight
John Legend - All of Me
Nessun dorma by pavoratti is hauntingly beautiful, Beethoven's ninth comes in at a much longer but equally beautiful second

Since I Left You - The Avalanches

The [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpqm-05R2Jk) that accompanies it is also very bittersweet and wonderful.
What Could Have Been - Sting & Ray Chen

Was not prepared for a song made for a scene in a series based on a game to hit me like a damn freight train.


*There are a lot but this is really recent and really caught me off guard*
Sound of Silence - Disturbed cover
Weird Fishes/Arpeggi and Nude, basement version by Radiohead. Followed by Everlong and Kalopsia.
I think everyone should listen to Hozier's songs. It was an experience. "Would that I" is unimaginable and "Like I Real People Do" feels like a hug from the gods.
Royal Blue by Cold War Kids

The Greatest Show on Earth by Nightwish

On a different kind of beautiful: 5 Dollar Bastard by Shotgun Facelift. It's very cathartic.
[Peter Gabriel f/ Kate Bush - Don’t Give Up](https://youtu.be/VjEq-r2agqc)
My pick is [Wasted Time - The Eagles](https://youtu.be/rUdbbC3Beo4)
Unclear by Kodaline. Makes me cry cos of the lyrics and melody
"Dust in the Wind" by Kansas.
True story - for some odd reason, Bruce Springsteen's "BORN TO RUN" makes me bawl my eyes out. Like joyful, emotional release. I do not know exactly why but it just GETS ME. I imagine running away with the girl I love, and I can FEEL his passion and emotions in the song. The music itself just has such a triumphant, extravagant sound. It just reaches some primal part of me and the tears just erupt, and I witness it incredulously as it surprises me every time I hear it.
Woodkid - Iron
Radical dreamers from Chrono cross

Everything's alright from to the moon
“Going to California” by Led Zeppelin
I wanna rank it so that i can say all my beautiful songs here:  
1. Never gonna give you up by Rick Astley (yes because he is precious and really sounding good for his age)  
2. Fire Emblem: Three Houses theme song (gorgeous song.)  
3. Who are you by Pelican Fanclub (if you know, you know T\_T)
Rain Song - Led Zeppelin
Annie’s Song - John Denver, Sound of Silence - Simon and Garfunkel, Fire and Rain - James Taylor
To build a Home.
Orion
Duk Koo Kim by Sun Kil Moon. The pain and acceptance in that song is absolutely breathtaking. Listen and read into the backstory if you never have.

Also would like to add Helplessness Blues, Stop This Train, and Gravity as honorable mentions. I’m in college, and I’ve cried driving back after being home during break with Stop This Train playing before.
I will - the beatles

Por Una Cabeza - Gardel (there was a version by a small string orchestra that was amazing, I'd share it but I can't find it on youtube. The only thing I can remember was the lead violinist who spoke for a while in French afterwards had asiatic features and an incredible grip on how to make a violin move you).

The man who sold the world - Bowie (yes everyone loves the Nirvana cover, I've just always loved the last harmonies at the end of the song in this version. When you're grieving they seem to hold all the sorrow in the world...) .

Ave Maria - Schubert

Equinox part 7 - Jean Michel Jarre

La Vie En Rose (I prefer Armstrong, my Father liked Piaf, they're both amazing)

Everloving - Moby
Naming 1 song is kind of ridiculous. However, what sprang to mind as I read the question was a live recording of The Dead performing Fire On the Mountain. I'm not a deadhead, but it was very beautiful.
Arrival of the birds by cinematic orchestra
Was there a Spotify link posted?
Hm. I feel like "Ghost Love Score" by Nightwish is definitely up there.

My Sweet Lord - George Harrison
Waiting For My Real Life to Begin by Colin Hay
Kaskade - 4am
The 8th Alley, Halozy. I found it on a night where I was having horrible gender dysphoria and dissociation, and the song was so beautiful yet nostalgic that it made me cry. [Link for easy access](https://youtu.be/rYVMIEBnpTo)

I am torn... But here are my top 3:

Classical Gas by Chet Atkins. It is the sweetest single guitar composition ever, in my opinion. It has such range, and so many movements in such a short amount of time.

Louis Armstrong's recording of What a Wonderful World always brings me to tears, especially knowing about the racism he encountered throughout his life. To hear him sing such a sweet song of optimism just breaks my heart. 

Then of course Beethoven's Ode to Joy. It is so triumphant and uplifting, I can't hear it and not be filled with emotion. Also it is the basis for the score of the greatest action movie ever. I trust I don't need to name names here.
My weakest by Delicate

Not very well known, but absolutely beautiful. I listen to it when I'm not feeling the best, often while hungover.
Fairytale by Alexander Rybak, the violin is just indredible.

Dance with my Father- Luther Vandross and written by Richard Marx.
Art Garfunkel and Amy Grant with a children’s choir, singing the most unique Christmas album I’ve ever heard, ‘The Animals’ Christmas. ‘Words from an old Spanish carol’ immediately crossing into ‘Carol of the Birds’. Haunting.
Dust In the Wind by Kansas
Riviera Paradise by Stevie Ray Vaughan. Especially his live version from Austin City Limits.
I Prevail - Everytime you leave!! One of the best songs I’ve ever heard in my life! It tells a great story in the song about someone leaving. And it’s just soo beautiful.

I don’t have a definitive answer but two very beautiful songs are Godspeed by frank ocean and runaway by Kanye west

Cien Años by Pedro Infante comes to my mind. It’s very hard choosing one.
"Wonder of U"- Elvis Presley.

The one that I had the biggest emotional reaction to was I Will Follow You into the Dark by Death Cab for Cutie. I first heard it on the episode of Scrubs and it hit hard.
Well, today it is Final Ascent by Hans Zimmer, used in the scene where James Bond is saying goodbye to Madeleine. Happened across the scene on youtube, it had me in tears a minute in...I had to look up the music.

I don’t know why I comment on these threads that already have like 7k comments but hands down “Time Adventure” sung live by Rebecca sugar at I think a comic con panel (she does the music for the cartoon adventure time). The creator Pendleton Ward is absolutely ugly sobbing through it while she does this little diddy just her on ukulele. It’s especially heartbreaking if you know the context of the show and the relationship of Simon and Betty.
Sunflower River Blues by John Fahey
Cowboy Junkies - Sweet Jane or Misguided Angel
Asaf Avidan - The Labyrinth Song
The Tragically Hip - Fiddler's Green
I really like Dearly Beloved from the Kingdom Hearts games.
Omega - Gyöngyhajú lány
Hurt - Johnny Cash (especially with the music video)

Knowing that his wife (who appeared in the video) died only a 3 months later and he died 7 months after filming you can sense that he took the lyrics to heart and that was a legend saying goodbye.

NiN even said they gave the song its body but Cash gave it its soul and were almost in tears after seeing it for the first time.

Simply a beautiful song
The most beautiful rap I've heard is a french song called "Je suis" by Big Flo et Oli. The message of this song is beautiful.
Ram Ranch
You are my sunshine
I will always love you by Whitney Huston
The main title to Star Wars upon a new release.

I love lighting crashes- LIVE. 
Far Behind-Candlebox 
Idk if the words are that great but the music just gets me.
I tried to think through a few different options but decided to go with the first song that popped in my head when I read the question. Dark Globes by Syd Barrett. If a way you could call the song "ugly" too, but I think it has a very unique beauty to it.
High Hopes by Pink Floyd. Stunner.
maa on niin kaunis by Saara Aalto
Crustfall by Days n’ Dayz. The subject matter in their music hits me hard, this song in particular gets me in my feels. I love the sound of their music, although I think it may not be for everybody.

"Waters of March" by Susannah McCorkle 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa2kuAYOpBE
It is a close tie between Ripples in the Sand from the new Dune movie or Cornfield Chase from Interstellar. Hans Zimmer, man.
Blue in Green by Miles Davis and A Thousand Years by Sting. 

The latter is about living many lifetimes (a pilgrim, a knight, a thief etc.) and falling in love with the same person. So beautiful.
Anchor or Haven by Novo Amor
Remember Christmas Harry Nilsson. As a kid a local station carried a local show called Beyond Our Control. At the end credits they played Remember Christmas  along with some old clips. I would sit there watching and crying. I later played it with a video montage of my kids as they grew and they all cried.

Dotted Line by Pinegrove was the last song I heard and every time I hear it I’m reminded of how beautiful it is. Like I forget, it comes on and I have that eureka moment all over again
All I Ever Wanted by the Airborne Toxic Event. It's so sad but sounds breathtakingly beautiful.
Only time by Enya or only time will tell by Asia:)

I never have just one, but the Tragically Hip's ["It's A Good Life If You Don't Weaken"](https://youtu.be/85k4RxqRyv8) is a contender. RIP Gord.
grouper - id rather be sleeping
I've probably heard Landslide by Fleetwood Mac over a thousand times throughout my life, but recently every time I listen to it I break down in tears. It carries a very different meaning for me as an adult, realizing that we and everything around us will continue to change, nothing stays the same, and that can be terrible but it can also be beautiful.
if i could go back in time i would do it just to hear first love / late spring by mitski for the first time again.

I absolutely love this song, even with the fucked up meaning behind it
Right before my eyes (unpeeled version) cage the elephant
Oltremare by Ludavico Einaudi
Adiago for strings. Any other answer would be untrue. It is a song of mourning and pure unfiltered melancholy, that mixes into something cataclysmically impactful upon the soul.
Wild Flower by Skyylark.  One hit wonder ,but I  love it , and about another million other songs.  There is so many old and new, it’s hard  to pick just one. I love old classic  tunes.

Reel around the fountain - the smiths

The way the last verse is introduced is just beautiful.

Spirit Bird by Xavier Rudd
Wichita Lineman, Glenn Campbell, tied with Cat Stevens Father and Son.

Baby - Justin bieber :)
For me it’s got to be Motion Picture Soundtrack by Radiohead
Echoes live in Pompeii - Pink Floyd
Clair de lune by Claude Debussy
slide on me - sideways - florida by frank ocean. the way these three songs transition into each other is like a beautiful ombré of sound. florida is easily one of the most beautiful songs i’ve listen to.
Every single elvish song

Amazing Grace sung by aaron neville on the jay leno show. I could never find a copy of it.  It was beautiful and sad.

Xtal aphex twin
[Hiru no Tsuki](https://youtu.be/H6ojLNsoi0w), the ending theme from Outlaw Star. There is no other way to describe it other than absolutely beautiful. It moves me to tears almost every time I listen to it, there's just something so haunting about it.
[East Coast Racer](https://youtu.be/saA2bMLvD2g), by Big Big Train
Good Riddance - Ashley Barrett, Darren Korb

This is a song from a video game called Hades. The first time I walked into the chamber where the female character sings this song, I stood in the room  for about 20 minutes letting the song loop over and over again. It’s haunting.
One Summer’s Day - Joe Hisaishi
Loneliness and the scream - Frightened Rabbit
Strobe by Deadmau5. It's honestly a masterpiece.

Peter Gabriel's "When you're falling".  The version with Afro-Celt Sound System.

Orbital - Halcyon on and on
Ripple by The Grateful Dead
An air to bethlehem/ a gift for a king. This song makes me want to experience traveling the world and enjoy life
All My Days- Alexi Murdoch
I’d say either “The Parting Glass”- from assassins creed (don’t judge me it’s the best version and I don’t know the real singer.) Or “Pure Love” by Collin Hay
Truly madly deeply by savage garden! Parents’ wedding song!
On the nature of daylight. It’s like the human condition - everything it is to be human and to exist so briefly - is contained in one piece of music

Sia - "Breathe" is up there. Also Kate Bush - "And Dream Of Sheep"
Steady heart kameron Marlowe
Rainbow Connection by Kermit.
Hrm..... Faure's Cantique de Jean Racine, Alegria from Cirque de Soleil, what else....
It isn’t perfect by any means, but “Panda” by Okay wrecks me every time
"Xochicuicatl" Sung by  Ixya Herrera. 

Its an old nahuatl song  and I love her version.
Annika by Björn Olsen sounds nice

Laura Palmer - Bastile 
Cirice - Ghost
Glassy sky above, as long as I’m alive you will be part of me...
[All my little words](https://youtu.be/1uQFlNa1Dk0) by The Magnetic Fields. With a few minor edits, I could see a father singing it to his daughter on her wedding day. It brings a tear or two to my eye when I listen to it in that context. Also, [Sober](https://youtu.be/nspxAG12Cpc) by Tool. It expresses the essence of addiction and despair so succinctly that it ends up being unequivocally beautiful. Plus, the singer’s voice is amazing.
Ribs - The Crane Wives. This just breaks my damn heart
M83- Wait and 
Sleeping At Last- Saturn

That good sad stuff.

Lazarus by David Bowie broke me.  Especially watching the video. I was a big Bowie fan and that last album was a cathartic grief process.  The title song Blackstar is also worth a listen. 


Frühling in Paris by Rammstein. Also by Rammstein, Amour and Klavier.
No Hell by Cloud Cult
Pool by Samia - makes me feel like i could float right out of this hell world
When you listen within the entirety of its context within the show - “You Will be Found” from Dear Evan Hansen is up there.
Somebody that i used to know - gotye
[Moldau by Smetana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G4NKzmfC-Q)

Close your eyes and imagine you're a trickle of water finding it's way down the mountains turning into a stream and then a very large river passing:

* Some Hunters - The horns going bomm ba-ba-da-baa

* A Wedding - Polka undertones (bada-dat-dat-dat-da-dada)

* A Canyon Under Moonlight - timpani rhythmically fades into bassoon and a wispy winds dreamlike sequence

* Sunrise - Main theme returns with a seemingly sluggish tempo

* Rapids - Aggressive swirling chaos w/ heavy brass, shrilling winds/strings, and thunderous timpani and percussion

* Prague - Regal homecoming feel with bursts of horns to emulate firing cannons of the castle

* Out of Sight - Fading strings as the river disappears over the horizon

* Jump Scare - Boo, caught you sleepin
It’s a toss up between Miserere Mei Deus by Gregorio Allegri, Spem in Alium by Talis and Elgar’s Enigma Variations IX (the latter of which I have tattooed on my arm)
Goodbye To A World - Porter Robinson. That is absolutely fantastic and I’m so glad I found it
Queen - Love of my life (Live)
can’t cut loose - erin rae

Northwest Passage by Stan Rogers
Brian Eno's The Ascent,  This Song Will Destroy You (not sure if I'm getting the name right,  sorry),   Ave Maria,  Hallejulah sung by a guy whose name I forget (not by the writer Cohen)...jeez my brain is fried from Netflix binges.   How annoying.
The mash up lullaby my 3yo sings every night at bed time. She just randomly inserts fairy tales and mixes up the words in the standard bedtime songs. It's so sweet it'll give ya diabetes.
A.P.D.I.T.A. - Jay Electronica x Jay Z
Stairway to heaven - Heart live cover
Wave on Wave by Pat Green.  I just got into line dancing, and I'm not a big Country fan, but this song is beautiful.

Also, Right Down the Line by Gerry Rafferty.
Promises by Randy Travis...so sad and so beautiful
O Holy Night
Any Other Name by Thomas Newman. Not a single lyrics, but it hits harder than most other songs out there.
Gun by avatar

Ode to Joy by Beethoven.
most things by eden reall. dudes genius. crash is my fav song.

Also worth mentioning is The Shire theme from LOTR.
Unchained Melody
Wings For Marie part 1&2 - Tool
Rainbow eyes - Rainbow

Love Dio's voice on that one
clair de lune is such a beautiful masterpiece
1) No Quarter by Led Zeppelin, then covered by Tool. The original so raw and beautiful, the cover so technically brilliant and creative. Both are incredible.
2) Sound of Silence by Simon & Garfunkel, then covered by Disturbed. The original so folky and pure, the cover just raw and haunting.
all my little words - the magnetic fields

also saint simon by the shins gets an honorable mention
I probably cannot choose only one or might pick something else if you asked me anoter time but Keane’s On a Day Like Today definitely is one of the most beautiful (albeit bittersweet in theme) song I ever heard.

Hozier’s rendition of The Parting Glass. I first heard the song when I finished assassins creed: black flag and I wanted to hear it again because of how moving the song was in the game.

Mamy songs are beautiful in a different way.
Personally, "Song of the Nihilist" by doom metal band Thrawsunblat is quite a beautiful one, for its positive ending.

Daniel’s Joik by Jon Henrik Fjallgren
As Ballad by Lambert
KOAN Sound’s Remix of Apashe’s Distance. It’s not my favorite song but my god is it well designed, doesn’t feel like 5 minutes at all
I'll be in the minority here with a classical piece, but I'm moved to tears when I hear Frederic Chopin's Nocturne in C Minor (Opus 48 no. 1). Chopin had a great deal of depression and it really shows in some of his works. This particular piece is a crazy rollercoaster of despair, beauty, and euphoria. 

A similar piece is the deceptively simple-sounding Prelude in E Minor (Opus 28 no. 4). In every note you can feel the pain. He specifically requested that this piece be played at his funeral, and his wish was granted. 

I also love Claude Debussy's early work. Of course Claire de Lune is the best known, and it is definitely an incredible piece (depending on the performer), but my favorite of his is Arabesque no. 1. It's whimsical and magical and peaceful and romantic. I always imagined if I ever get married, this would be my choice for the first dance.
Rhapsody in blue . Gershwin .
Either Eleanor Rigby (Cody Fry’s version) or Turn to Stone by ELO.
The Upside by Lindsey Stirling kills me every time it comes on. The instrumental version just has my whole body move and there isn't a note out of place in the entire song.
Man of Oil - animal collective
The Stranglers: Golden Brown
Nutshell- Alice in Chains
To Make You Feel My Love - Adele (my first dance with my wife)
Hallelujah - Rufus Wainwright (a brilliant depression song that speaks to the soul)
Take Me Home - Phil Collins (the whistful melody and beautiful harmonies can take you anywhere your mind will let you).
Diamonds and Rough by Joan Baez.
Green Bird by the Seatbelts. Mostly because of the scene it plays in episode 5 of Cowboy Bebop.
Obscured - Smashing Pumpkins
Shape of my Heart by Sting.  It's a beautiful song but the music builds to a top note towards the end of the song that just sounds so complete and perfect. It gets to me every time.
Through the Fire and Flames by DragonForce
“The Prayer” by Celine Dion and Andrea Bochelli. So moving and beautiful even though I’m not much for religion. It’s just a lovely wish.
Space Lion by the Seatbelts not a word is spoken and yet whenever I listen I feel weight less and calm
To have you  by For those I love 
Tragic loss of authors best friend and music collaborator

A very difficult question to me, but “Schindler’s List” by John Williams is definitely one of the most beautiful violin pieces I have ever heard.
Ok there’s a video of a cover of Everybody Wants to Rule The World on the hammered dulcimer that the singer from tears for fears is just sitting in a swinging chair and singing and vibing. It’s so peaceful

Edit: found it! Enjoy https://youtu.be/iAFT4eVX5Ak
Dive- Ed Sheeran 
Please don't over play it on the radio and ruin it
Drops of Jupiter by Train. It's my all-time favourite song and gives me frisson when that first note hits. The opening lines came to Pat Monahan in a dream shortly after his beloved mother died. "Now that she's back in the atmosphere..." and the rest of the song developed from there. It's about life, love, loss, self-discovery, and redemption. It's an important reminder that as long as we still love the people we've lost they're never truly gone. At my worst, it's a good top-of-the-lungs singalong. And at my best, it makes me happy cry because it's so unmatchedly inspirational.
Who’s Behind the Door by Zebra
Private Universe by Crowded House.
[Miserere mei, Deus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miserere_%28Allegri%29?wprov=sfla1).

Yes - McAlmont & Butler

Love this tune, I find it very uplifting
Don’t Speak - Postmodern Jukebox, One of the reason is that it is sung by Haley Reinhart who I consider is the most beautiful voice I have heard and the other reason is that Scott Bradlee did an amazing job converting No Doubt’s song into his own.

Spiegel Im Spiegel by Arvo Pärt. If you’ve watched the Good Place, it’s the song that plays during the Wave Speech.

A boy and a girl by Eric Whitacre
Sea of Voices — Porter Robinson
Not necessarily songs but here are a few classical/instrumental things that I think are utterly beautiful.  Even if you're like 'meh classical' then I would urge/hope you have a listen - if you hate it then you've lost nothing.  But maybe there's something in there that moves you like it does me.

[Lachrimosa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLo8Fs_nWU&ab_channel=GrandoVoce)

[O Fortuna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJC-_j3SnXk&ab_channel=Andr%C3%A9Rieu)

[Sienna by Paul Leonard Morgan (who is an insanely great composer who works in film/TV/games.  This is my favourite track from his Film Tales album)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPyFovPDV4M)

NON CLASSICAL 

[Tori Amos - Winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PDlGUdDF8Y&ab_channel=UPROXXIndieMixtape).  It never fails to make me emotional.  [In fact the entire Little Earthquakes album is still a total emotional kick in the guts even *good god* 30 years after it was released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PDlGUdDF8Y)
Without a doubt: Shriekback- This Big Hush

I have a collection called Walk Softly and Carry a Big Sound. All of it is gorgeous melancholy brilliance.
I don't think I'd go that far, but when I discovered lately and really dig is Wave Over Wave by Great Big Sea. Just lovely

A little bias but

Sunshine? By Shards of Grey
Either My Sweet Lord or Here Comes The Moon both by George Harrison
Your distant world- Simon o shine. This was the first uplifting progressive trance songs I’ve heard that made me nearly cry. Even without any need for lyrics the soul and emotion with this song hits deep with those of who are ones who feel melodic trance music.  The piano and synths alone are next to none especially when hearing something like it for the first time.  It is a longer song and it is a very progressive song, but that Is why I enjoy it even more. But there is also an shorter edited version in case the beginning is a bit long for some. 

If you enjoy trance, this will be a great song to caress your ears.

Andromeda by Weyes Blood.
For me, it’s breezin by George Benson. Such a nice happy song

Passionflower - Jon Gomm

Beautiful and unique. Simple but deep. Intricate but pure. A man and his guitar singing about flowers and so much more.
Love Space - Tatsuro Yamashita
Sunday Morning Coming Down by Kris Kristofferson.  It’s has some grit to it but I hear a prevailing hope in it.

Octavarium by Dream Theater
Never Meant by American Football. This is a very personal one for me.
I can't remember the name of the song or the performer. But there was this song that repeated "I love you,.. I love you,... I love you" slowly in the chorus at this restaurant I worked at in around 2006-8. It was a male singer, no accent, English.
I have never heard this song anywhere else. It is definitely one of the most beautiful songs I can't remember.

Long, wonderful memory to follow.  


I was staying on Midway Atoll. Once the site of a pivotal WWII battle, Midway today is sleepy by comparison. Hulks of war machinery rot next to historic buildings scattered all over the island. Nowadays, the only flight in every week had to land at night after the colony of seabirds had gone to bed. Beneath the waves is a slice of one of the largest protected coral reefs on earth, and threatening that otherwise pristine environment is an endless march of ghost fishing nets that center on the island from all over the Pacific to smother the fragile corals. Between the rangers, the people that maintain the active runway, biologists, the occasional influential politician, and marine debris technicians, there are around 50 people on the island at any given time. I was one of the debris techs, and by the time this memory occurred, I had been working hard and was about to get my first day off in two weeks!  


My days were spent on boats and my evenings fixing those boats.  I hadn't heard much music during my stay there. The entertainment that evening mostly entailed watching the flight for that week land. Needing some solidarity, I wandered off to a quiet patch of field surrounded only by sleeping seabirds, put my earbuds in place, and set my ipod to shuffle. I didn't realize it, but my ears were hungry for music. What came through the earpiece was a song that I had downloaded just before my trip called "Divenire" by Ludovico Einaudi. It was a simple, minimalist piano melody that struck me straight in the emotions. It was as if Ludovico wasn't playing a piano, but he was playing a nerve in my heart.   


In such a wild place under such special circumstances, I was in tears by the time the plane finally came in. It will always be one of my more beautiful memories.

Not beautiful music wise but the message in the song makes it beautiful and that's a little bit off by five finger death punch  
As someone with sensory processing disorder I have days where I don't know what is wrong because I can't process my emotions due to it and this song makes me feel alright knowing that everyone can feel a little bit off on days

Haris Alexiou - To Tango Tis Nefelis
https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=lF3zt_Gj3uk&feature=share

It's a Greek tango song that I fell in love with when I danced Argentine Tango. There's almost certainly more beautiful songs, but I'm biased for this one for all the magnificent dances I've had to it.

I Giorni by Ludovico Einaudi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2K7D-uMH2g

"The inspiration for Ludovico Einaudi's I Giorni was a 12th-century folk song from Mali about a hippopotamus who was cherished by the residents of a nearby village but killed by a hunter. 'The song,' writes Einaudi in his succinct liner note, 'is sung as a lament for the death of a king or a great person or for the loss of a loved one.' The result is a tender and introspective set of 14 piano pieces. This work was written after Einaudi heard the kora playing of Toumani Diabate whilst travelling in Mali."
Goreki by Lamb
Probably a little cliche but Clair de Lune by Debussy. I wish I could go back and listen to that song for the first time again

"Lebanon", from "The Moon". Or a"A day in the life" The Beatles
it’s a new song but “Superstar” by Beach House is just so ethereal and pleasant for the ears
Eric Whitacre’s Seal Lullaby - hauntingly beautiful harmonies, always sends chills up my spine and brings tears to my eyes. The lyrics are from a poem by Rudyard Kipling, a lullaby sung by a mother seal to her baby. It sounds silly when you describe it, but it’s so beautiful and pure.
To Build a Home - Cinematic Orchestra
“Daydreaming” by dark dark dark.

Fire In The Hole - Earl Sweatshirt
It's not in English but a Greek song called An Eisai Ena Asteri. It means If you are a star.

Auld Lang Syne by Dan Fogelberg
Canon in d tbh
Angeles by Elliot Smith, Love Song by The Cure, God Only Knows by The Beach Boys. Too many to name.
The most beautiful song ive ever heard is a song called "tus dos vestidos" by my fav Mexican folk/country group Los Tigres del Norte. 

The song translates to "your two dresses". Its about a man on his deathbed telling his wife goodbye. Some of the lyrics say "youre going to look beautiful in your black dress." "If in white you said I do. In black youll say goodbye." "My destiny is written, I must go along." 
"When Im absent, grab our children firmly by the hand and show them the right path... if the burden becomes too much, seek the shadow of another man. I just ask that he loves you just as much as me" 

https://youtu.be/CsO5owNH0-0

This same group sings all sorts of stories. One song they gave is about a man who gets cheated on by his wife. His wife runs off with another man. He raises his kids by himself and they ask about their mom. He doesnt have the heart to tell them the truth so he invents a lie that shes dead. The dad takes the kids to the cemetary where the kids cry and leave flowers for their mom at somebody elses tomb. 
At some point the wife regrets her decision and wants to return. He sings "how can I revive the dead?"

Everything I do (I do it for you) - Bryan Adams
Not really a traditional song, but I love the Cianwood City Theme from Pokémon Gold and Silver. I always listen to it regardless of mood.
Surf by Mac Miller
[**Home** by *The Legendary Pink Dots*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uZNN9vtLY4)

It's a simple instrumental, yet with depth, and just the right bit of strange beauty lurking outside the frame.
Kanye Only One
Show me - seal. Beautiful doing about just wanting to help but you're lost on how to start
beautiful by christina aguilera
Last Kiss - Pearl Jam cover.

Can't decide which
[Wax fang - Majestic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B6E0mijV5A)
My mother used to sing us old old English and Scottish ballads to put us to sleep. Now I’m hopelessly partial to sad, antique melodies. A few of my favorites -

Geordie
The Great Selkie
One about a young lord who dies with an unborn child - “he’s young but he’s daily growing.”

And some American and more modern ones that are in the same tradition. There’s an Appalachian miner’s song called the Red-Winged Blackbird about black lung disease which is fairly devastating. 

Some of this sound has even made it into modern pop music. I’m thinking of Dust in the Wind, which I think is one of the prettiest “rock” songs out there.
The last 6 minutes of Everywhere at the End of Time by The Caretaker. Every time I listen the whole album, none other than the part I mentioned gives me the same vibe which I'd describe as a soothing end to one's agony. I'm not good with words, but I believe people who listened the album know what I mean.
For me Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 2 is personally the most beautiful *piece* that came to mind. But *song* is much harder to narrow down to even three. 

How interesting to see the handful that are repeated here, and looking forward to listening to so many I’ve never even heard of before. 

We are all the same and also all different.
white ferrari by frank ocean
“Fade into You” by Mazzy Star is definitely out there for me. “Love Reign O’er Me” by The Who is also pretty great.
Signs - Bloc Party

Not ever, but the one that has my attention currently. Not necessarily for the sound but for that deep, achy feeling it evokes
Labrinth..beneath your beautiful
Clair De Lune by Claude debussy. Or really any Clair De Lune.
Himesh Patel’s cover of The Long and Winding Road from the movie Yesterday. It’s just his vocals and the piano. I like the original, but something about it just being the piano, it brings a tear to my eye every time. I’d also like to throw in Yesterday by the Beatles, may be cliche but one of the greatest Beatles songs in my opinion.
May it be by Enya is nice
Anything by Jor Hisaishi, but especially Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle soundtracks.

Faure's Pavane, done by Bobby McFerrin
River Flows In You by Yiruma
Il Mondo by Jimmy Fontana
Moonshadow (1970s) forgot the singer.
Megan - Bayside ft Josh Caterer (Album - Acoustic)

I’ve always loved this acoustic version of the song, originally by Smoking Popes. The lyrics just hit differently in this one.
Probably The Parchment or The Thin Line Between Love and Hate, both by Iron Maiden
The night we met - Lord huron
Blackmill - Let it Be deserves to be on this thread
constance by spiritbox  
sad but beautiful
Some of the songs I wanted to put have already been put on here so I'll try to keep some of these unique:

A Gallant Gentleman - We Lost The Sea

Maybe a tad generic, but Gymnopédie No.1 by Erik Satie really is just that good IMO.

Take Me Somewhere Nice or Kids Will Be Skeletons by Mogwai

Woolworm - Indian Summer

Five Silent Miles - Ameican Football

If I had to pick the most beautiful out of all of these? Probably would go either Gymnopédie No.1 or Take Me Somewhere Nice. Both feel very relaxing and beautiful.
22 (Over Soon) - Bon Iver

Shoutout to any other Legion fans that found this song the same way I did
Max Richter - on the nature of daylight
Impossible to pin it down to just a few, but these are way up there:

Any time I hear this song I just instantly relax and fall in love again. It may be the only song that I have to finish listening to every time no matter where I am or what I’m doing.
https://music.amazon.com/user-playlists/805842fadce449c5be5989f0c8eef6d7sune?ref=dm_sh_OPhJfkpgmY1LebN1vncNecOuH

It ain’t much but it’s honest work
Carole King - So Far Away. On an absolute masterpiece of an album.
Captain - Dave Matthews Band, from the Lillywhite Sessions.

If you want to know what rock-bottom sounds like listen to this song. You can feel the depression and despair in the words and his voice and the music. The breakdown is one of the most heart-rending pieces of music I've ever heard. The song just moves me in ways few songs ever have.

https://youtu.be/9ckdu7AnK1Q
Jason Isbell - If We Were Vampires
The parting glass by the Clancy brothers and Tommy Mackem
Samuel Barber's *Adagio for Strings*. Most people know it from *Platoon* but it hits me every time.

This years love - David gray Has me crying and feeling hopefull at The same time every time I hear it. 


Hey laura- gregory porter is lovely too
Love Sosa- Chief Keef
Little fugue in G minor, Bach.
The Canyon Behind Her -dredg

The capstone of an alt/prog/jazz/rock concept album about sleep paralysis themed around the art of Salvador Dalí. It ends with a beautiful choral piece symbolizing a person awakening from a dream. Admittedly, there is a bit of an emotional connection as my favorite concert moment ever happened while they were playing this song.
https://youtu.be/IQCb6HMqwbk
Dry Flower - Yuuri
Dream Sweet in Sea Major
Zoe Jane, by Staind, has me in tears every time. It's very relatable since I work away from home for weeks at a time

There's a modern version done by the theatre company "Sight and Sound" and I get chills every time...
Humbling River by puscifer.

Jackson Browne - For a Dancer 


Incubus - If Not Now, When Will I?

She's a woman by Billy Joel
If you’ve watched archive 81, you know it
Lana Del Rey. That's it
“Black” by Pearl Jam
Caribbean Blue by Enya.

Probably lost at the bottom of the thread, and so many other good choices, but my personal favorite.
One million lovers - The Growlers
The song reminds of the girl of my dreams. We talked so much in high school and did a lot together. Over time we grew apart and stop talking. I really wish I could of told her how I feel. There really is one million lovers, but none like hers.
Hit em up
Album of the year - The good life.

Such a time and place song for me, but amazing and beautiful.
Klass by Tom Ashbrook. Soothing, slow, classical (kinda) and almost feels like it tells a story without any words.
Last Night on Earth by Green Day really does it for me. I love everything about it. However, if we’re aiming a little more towards ‘beautiful’, either version of Cancer (originally by My Chemical Romance, covered by Twenty One Pilots) really makes me bawl.
Sparkle by radwimps, that meteor scene… godly visuals and soundtrack.
Canon in D—Johan Pachelbel

It gives me such a peaceful feeling.
eleanor rigby by the beatles
“ Wait”by M83 and “Sing for Absolution” by Muse
John Butler Trio - Ocean
Yes.

The sound your butt makes.

After you eat bean burritos.
I heard there’s people happened
Sounds of Silence by Disturbed
Jeff Buckley’s version of Hallelujah. I’m sure others have said it in this thread.
The Promise - Tracy Chapman
I don't know the name of it, and I've only heard it once.

It was a long time ago, I was driving down a lonely country road when my car broke down. This was before cell phones were really a thing (they existed, but were huge bricks that only the wealthy could afford). It was pretty late, but I knew that there was a town about 8 or 9 miles down the road, so I started walking. I'd gone probably 4 or 5 miles without seeing another car (I told you it was a lonely road) when I really needed to pee. Now, I probably could've peed right there, but i figured that's when another car would happen by, and with my luck it would be a cop. So I went off into the woods to drain the dragon and rest for a few minutes (I wasn't in the best shape).

I'm about to head back out to the road when I hear voices. I'm understandably a little freaked out and stop where I am, still in the woods a bit. After a few seconds, I see two guys walking up the road in the same direction I had been going. As they pass, I can see in the moonlight that they look like typical drifters/hitchhikers... A little dirty, guitars strung across their backs, carrying beat up old suitcases.

I don't want to freak these guys out by walking out of the woods towards them in the middle of nowhere (plus I was scared of getting beat up, robbed, or worse), so i figured I'd just rest a little longer and let them get on down the road ahead me.

Here's where it gets weird, and I always start losing people when I tell the story. I know that you probably won't believe me, but I don't care... I know what I saw that night. Anyway... they get about 50 yards down the road, and there's this noise, like a bolt of lightning splitting a tree in half two feet from you. At the same time, there's this blast of light and smoke in the middle of the road, just ahead of the two drifters. As quick as it began, the light and noise are gone, and in front of the drifters stands this... thing. I swear, it was ten feet tall if it was an inch. This thing was like every nightmare that a "hellfire and brimstone" Sunday school teacher could give a small child... horns on the head, hooves instead of feet, even the tail. And its skin... I don't know how to describe it... it's like it was shiny, bit at the same time seemed to absorb all light. It was purely demonic. 

This thing snarled at the drifters and told the drifters that it was going to eat their souls unless they played the best song in the world. And these two dudes just look at each other and are like, "ok." They grab their guitars and start to play and sing, and it's like heaven was formed by their music. Gorgeous would be an insult to the beauty of this music. I just stood in awe, transfixed.

After they finished, the beast just roared and accused the drifters of being angels sent to trap him or something. They told him that they were just mortal men, and it roared one last time and disappeared.

The two drifters just packed up their guitars and continued walking down the road like nothing had happened. I stood there watching until they were out of sight, then I sat down and cried. Partly because I realized that had I not stopped to pee, I might have been been the one confronted with the demon, and my soul surely would have been eaten... but mostly because, while my soul still felt the joy and peace that the song had instilled, even then, right after hearing it, I could not have told you anything about it. Not the lyrics, not the rhythm, not the tune. It was like I had heard something that human ears and brains can't comprehend, except while actually listening to it.

After a while I got up, brushed myself off, and finished the walk into town. I stopped in and the 24 hour diner there (the only thing open at that time). Inised their phone and had a cup of coffee while waiting for a friend to come pick me up. I had hoped to find the drifters in there, but didn't. Waitress said no one had been in for an hour or two before I came in except for a group of rowdy college kids who ate and left, and the old guy that was still sitting alone in the corner booth.

I sometimes wonder what happened to those drifters.

Love this song it's on my night play list and most likely unknown by most. Peter Bradley Adams-The Longer I Run
All of the Lights
Any disco/soul fans here?

Check out Stephanie Mills - What Cha Gonna Do With My Lovin'?  The moment the chorus hits, her beautiful voice and backing instrumentation just take off to another level.  Absolutely killer record.

If you like it I'll recommend more!
Metallica Nothing Else Matters would be my pick. Sir Elton John has recently stated that opinion as well.

Cloudbusting - Kate Bush

Romantic Flight from How To Train Your Dragon
"O Mundo é um Moinho" by Cartola. It's a brazilian song about having your dreams crushed by the world. It says: "Listen to me well, love/Pay attention, the world is a mill/It will grind your dreams, so stingy/It will cut illusions into dust". I like this version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJnQevM4JHI

My Song - ANC Music (this is the spotify listing. The song is a little hard to track down)

Maybe a little different than a lot of these as it's less about the music itself, and more the raw emotion of the vocals. Hearing someone pour their heart out to minimal musical accompaniment is always what strikes me as beautiful when it comes to music.

OR Lord Please Hear My Pray by Moses Hogan
Space Lion by The Seatbelts from the Cowboy bebop OST. Really that whole ost is a master piece but this is a go to song for me.

A close second is Bratja(Brothers) from the Fullmetal Alchemist sound track. The song is a bit heavy if you look up the lyrics. But man it just has a way of making me feel things.

This Bitter Earth / On the Nature of Daylight. It’s a superimposition Dinah Washington’s song over the Max Richter piece and years after first hearing it I can still listen to it on repeat. So gorgeously, painfully bittersweet. 

Liz On Top Of The World, from the 2005 Pride & Prejudice film, by Jean-Yves Thibaudet. If you’ve seen the film, you can’t help but imagine the scene it plays in - the piece invokes the imagery so well. Warm and soaring and lovely. 

Heaven (Candlelight Mix). DJ Sammy’s cover of the Bryan Adams song. One of my favorite stripped covers of all time.

Gabriel’s Oboe - all versions of this song, but I’m particularly fond of the Yo-Yo Ma cover and several versions of Nella Fantasia (the version with words put to it)
Aruarian Dance by Nujabes
Brazilian here! ["Tocando Em Frente" by Renato Teixeira/Almir Sater](https://youtu.be/SWtjTkixv5M). The most beautiful song in this country

I told my wife that this thread existed, planning to read some of the answers to her, and she immediately, without hesitation, named a song I’ve never heard in my life:  
  
Patty Larkin - “I Told Him That My Dog Wouldn’t Run”
Not sure if this counts because it's over an hour long, but Claudio Montiverdi's 1610 Vespers ( or *Vespers of the Blessed Virgin*) is the most beautiful music I've ever heard. 

( and I'm not Catholic.  Not even religious....)
The overture from Tannhaüser
Bring on the Clowns lol
Avatar’s Love
Across the stars by John Williams
I am a child by Neil Young.
I Wish I Was the Moon - Neko Case
Untitled by Interpol.
For me it's Majestic by Wax Fang. Famously used on American Dad
Chris Stapleton’s version of Tennessee Whiskey is AMAZING. His voice and the arrangement of the song is exquisite. Love the emotion in his tone
Funeral Canticle by John Tavener. Listen to it loud. It never fails to stir something in my heart. Almost brings me to tears.
Sun of Nothing by Between the Buried and Me and Hide & Seek by Imogen Heap. 

Also, Sleepwalk by Johnny and Santo
Beethoven Sonata Op2 No1 4th movement (especially the cadences Barenboim does those very well)
au fond du temple saint -- duet from The Pearl Fishers.   gives me goosebumps.
Reckoner - Radiohead
small worlds mac miller
Ashes on the fire
Blur - Sing
In a World Possessed by the Human Mind by the tragically hip

“Wonderful Tonight” is up there for me.
Map Change by Every Time I Die

I’m from upstate NY and the song and video hit home!
Jupiter, Bringer of Jollity by Gustav Holst

Glinka The Lark as well as Liszt Sonetto S104.
Sweden by C418
D.WIGHT - Outside Wars
The flower duet (lakme)

Robert Schumann - In the Wonderful Month of May
There are so many songs that could easily make the list for me, but if I had to pick off the top of my head right now, it’s Laura Brannigan’s version of Power of Love. When she belts out that last chorus, those highs just make my hair stand on end.
Shoreline - Deas Vail
River flows in you - Yiruma

https://youtu.be/7maJOI3QMu0
I'm Glad You're Evil Too by Pinocchio-P. One of the only songs that's moved me to tears.
It's in Japanese, but the lyrics aren't that important. It's all about the feeling.
there are probably more beautiful songs, but ELT by V Shape Mind is a really, really underappreciated gem. Like I bet nobody in this thread has heard it.

Here’s a link:

https://youtu.be/vLdnQbjw3a8
Above and beyond - Little Something
The Void -Kid Cudi
Heal - ICO OST

https://youtu.be/8RMDBqQDtT8

Not a Pink Floyd fan, but a Wish You Were Here fan.
Be Thou My Vision
Pilot Priest - The Last Goodbye
Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen

Is this real life?
Lockah - The Sour Drink From The Ocean
A little bit of everything by Dawes brings a tear to my eye every so often. Hits home in good and bad ways
Erik Satie - gymnopedie n1… it feels exactly like a rainy day.
At the moment its Tu Jhoom from coke Studio. Abida Parveen’s voice is smooth like honey and Naseebo Lal’s voice just has so much emotion in it.  The lyrics in itself is a song about self acceptance and dealing with life with grace.. about being happy with what you have, learning from your experiences and being thankful for the now. 

I was moved to tears when I heard the song for the first time. I have been squashing my desire to clutch people by their shoulders, declare my live for the song and make them listen to this masterpiece. So yes.

"Twilight" by Electric Light Orchestra.
What Sarah Said by Death Cab For Cutie.
Song to the Siren - This Mortal Coil.  Aww hell, just about anything from the Cocteau Twins...
Right on Time by Brandi Carlile is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard in a long long time.
Chopin’s Nocturne no 20 in C sharp minor. 

Mozart’s fantasia no 3 in D minor (also the clarinet one, Laudaute Dominum, the entire requiem, and so many more). 

Beethoven’s the emporer (this makes me sob sometimes if I’m really going through it.. it’s so beautiful)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCsLI5QfsUs
"Saturn" - Sleeping at Last
If we were Vampires by Jason Isbell
Either Gravity or Everglow by Coldplay.
Prettiest Eyes by the Beautiful South. He's talking about lines (maybe of a song or a book) building over someone's life, but then you realise he's talking about lines around your eyes and relating these to memories. Just beautiful.
Fireworks by First Aid Kit
Smooth operator - Sade. Everything just feels beautiful about that song to me.
Sohyang’s cover of “Bridge over troubled water”
Slip Into Something More Comfortable - by Kinobe.

Just a breath of light tropical air..
I am Australian,. By the Seekers 
Judith Durham's voice cuts to your soul like a knife and Bruce Woodleys lyrics hits like a hammer and stirs the blood of any Aussie .
Echoes by Pink Floyd
Let It Be by the Beatles
There’s lots, but one I’ll never forget and one that means the most to me, Long Live the Queen by Frank Turner. After I had my friend almost die and my girl dogs die (they were like sisters, acted like humans, I was raised with them, and they treated me better than my brother, so when I lost them, it was like losing a sibling. I think of them every time, including my friend too. Reminds me a little of my grandma, but not 100% like it does my dog since I was shown the song only months before people close and dead to me got ill, and my grandma died years before then.

Song brings me to tears when I sing it, playing it on the guitar is difficult for me since it means so much to me, I never will get over it.

I'd do anything for love by Meat Loaf, been my favourite song ever since I discovered it a couple years ago
R.I.P. Meat Loaf

Edit: Crowded House - Weather With You too, I love that song
Without wishing to add further to your inability to listen to everything...

[*When I'm Thinking About You* by the Sundays.](https://youtu.be/hwDTMS4oo6A)

Everything by the Sundays tbh, because Harriet Wheeler has the voice of an angel,  but that's probably my favourite.

Or possibly their cover of *[Wild Horses](https://youtu.be/9i-0FB68LoQ)* by the Rolling Stones, which was on Buffy that one time.
Haunting and complex. [Elliott Smith - Alameda](https://youtu.be/WcRgqXYmzZE) 1997, folk-rock

«Tribute»-Tenacious D, it covers all!
Hold On - Prismo
[The Witch and the Saint composed by Steven Reineke](https://youtu.be/y_qVLMptKkE)

It's a symphonic piece based off an old German story about twin sister's. You can read about it in the [Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witch_and_the_Saint)
I'm not sure off-hand, but a couple that come to mind:

Forever Love - X Japan

Indian Sunset - Elton John
Bud powell’s version of moonlight in vermont.   It ticks all the colours one can see and makes my hair stand up.   Gorgeous.
"there is a light that never goes out" by the smiths.  I'm young, only 14 turning 15 in March.  I have heard this song many many times throughout my whole life, my parents showed my siblings and me it when we were very young. I cant explain it. I have never been in love but have always wanted to find true love some day. My parents relationship is basically perfect, i want something like that, i always have. "to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die" what magical words of true love.

I've got to say The Leader of the Band by Dan Fogelberg.
Sarah by Rüfüs Du Sol
"The Last Goodbye" by Billy Boyd. I'm a huge LotR fan
Nightwish - Beauty of the Beast
First time I heard music of [Hildegard von Bingen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6qFCYRQKVA) I was walking by a small church and heard a woman practicing.  Not usually much for 11th century liturgical music but this was simply astounding.  I just sat there in wonder.
exile by Taylor Swift featuring Bon Iver. 

I recently discovered it on YouTube and I don't know if it's the most beautiful song, but it sure certainly hit different. Aaron Dessner from The National being one of the two producers (and playing piano in the music video) is great too.
Purple sneakers by Australian Band You Am I
Enauldi: Experience.. the crescendos, the way it brings it down like System of a Down .. it takes me on a fanciful journey
Divided sky. Phish
Good 4 u by Olivia Rodrigo
Two that come to mind at the moment:  Saint Preux - Concerto Para Uma Voz (this was samples in Wyclef Jean - Apocalypse),  Ann Humphreys With Greg Hawks - Moody River (does anyone know where I can find this online?),
Bjork:  Come to Me.  

There's some stuff on YouTube of her performing it live with like a 100 piece orchestra...the music is ethereal, the lyrics are perfect.
Eclipse by Pink Floyd, possibly the greatest ending track of an album in music history.
Sleep by Eric Whitaker as performed by Voces 8.

It's like the voices of angels, man

Otherwise, the movie Amelie has an incredible soundtrack in its entirety
Runaway by Aurora
Suffocate - J Holiday
predatory wasp by sufjan stevens
The Drug In Me Is Reimagined - Falling In Reverse
There's a song that makes me think of a girl. It's called "Believe" by Tales of the Forgotten, it makes me cry for her, I had the capacity to enthrall her with my stories, these magnificent worlds I could come up on the spot fictions original and rich, vast and diverse and she loved to hear them. I miss her a lot when I listen to this.
I know this won't be a popular choice, but I have *always* loved *Melodies of Life* from *FFIX.* I've never even played the game, but that song can bring tears to my eyes.

[This version](https://youtu.be/u-C8tcSovKY), sung as part of the Distant Worlds tour, though it has a slow lead in (the combined it for the set with another song) is just amazing.
Thank You by Led Zeppelin.
This specific performance of “As With Rosy Steps The Morn” from Handel’s “Theodora”: https://youtu.be/IQlt1UxjvWU
The thing about songs is it’s the context that matters.  I have some really above average songs that are my all time favorites just because they remind me a specific time of my life.
"Stella blue" - Grateful Dead
Pyramid Song, by Radiohead. It's about 20 years since I first heard it, but it still gives me shivers every time.

I probably have 3:
Hiatus kaiyote - Breathing underwater
Jacob Collier - he won't hold you

Reckoner - Radiohead. I know that Radiohead gets a bad rep from their obnoxious fans but this song is something special to me and I can’t help but appreciate its beauty when I listen to it.
It's a little sentimental but when I go through a rough patch, A letter to my younger self by Ambar Lucid gets me through it.
Hallelujah - jeff buckley  version
Just watch the fireworks- Jimmy eat world 

Aqueous transmission- incubus
**Mumford and Sons - After The Storm**

"There will come a time

You'll see, with no more tears

And love will not break your heart

But dismiss your fears

Get over your hill and see

What you find there

With grace in your heart

And flowers in your hair"
Great Gig In The Sky - Pink Floyd

Rick astley never gonna give you up or The soviet union national anthem

There are SO many i could say but i truly truly love Only Time by Enya. 
It gives me nostalgia of when i was young and stayed with my grandparents who have since passed. It's my comfort song!!
Creep - PMJ & Hayley Reinhardt
Milk & Honey - Jackson C Frank
Vincent- Don McLean

Beautiful lyrics and guitar that compliments his voice perfectly. His lyrics capture Van Gough's tortured life perfectly.

Some of my favorite lines:

"They could not listen, they did not know how. Perhaps they'll listen now."

"And when no hope was left inside on that starry, starry night, you took your life as lovers often do. But I could have told you, Vincent, this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you."

And the closing line:

"They would not listen, they're not listening still. Perhaps they never will."

Song to the siren- this mortal coil
god speed by frank ocean
Illusion by VNV Nation. Very sad song
Star Shopping
My all-time favorite is Lady in Black by Uriah Heep.
Feel Flows by the Beach Boys. Such a melancholy sweetness that lingers in my soul each time I hear it
Whiter Shade of Pale by Procol Harem. I first heard that song in the movie Fandango which I love to this day. But I think it's one of the most beautiful modern ballads.
Gravity - Sara Bareilles. It perfectly captures the feeling of being completely in love with someone that is hurting you. It's so beautifully tragic, exactly like the situation is describing.
I had the extreme honor, in my senior year of high school, debuting a song for composer Z. Randall Stroope called [Dance for Love](https://youtu.be/fZtVQ5gT8Co) in Carnegie Hall. It was one of my greatest and most inspiring experiences and I only wish it could have lasted longer. From time to time I come back to this song, still remembering my part.
The Way That I Live - Ed Harcourt

Amazing lyrics
Blumenthal by Ulrich Schnauss
Forbidden Colours - David Sylvian & Ryuichi Sakamoto

Waterfront - David Sylvian 

Both achingly beautiful, but the first is better known,  due to the instrumental version being the theme to the film,  Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence.
Lyrically, my most beautiful song is The Gardener by The Tallest Man on Earth. It really captures the longing and drive to be something greater for someone else, feeling like an imposter, but in trying to keep up the lie eventually becoming that something greater. 

Musically, my favorite is Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes from Paul Simon. It's got the wonderful vocal swells of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, these beautifully playful and bright arpeggios on the guitar, wonderful rhythm. It's just fantastic, the whole Graceland album is great.
One that comes to mind for me is Dylan's "Youre a Big Girl Now". I have a Seinfeld Desperado moment every time I hear it and if possible, stop what Im doing and just listen to it.
Beauty and the Beast, maybe
Reckless (Don't Be So) by Australian Crawl and The Sound of White by Missy Higgins
Same
People=Shit by Slipknot

Love of My Life by Queen.
The Parting Glass by The High Kings. So much aspects of mourning captured beautifully in this song.

Strobe - Deadmau5
There was this Remix of Omen reprise + invaders must die by the Prodigy in the World's on Fire tour that just transcended me into another realm of awesomeness.
Infinite Amethyst, by Lena Raine.

Incredible.
For some reason, both "Cuarteles de Invierno" (Winter Quarters) and "Los Días Raros" (the Odd Days, the Weird Days), from Vetusta Morla, struck me as incredibly beautiful, sad, melancholic songs.

They make me feel both nostalgic and safe in a different time. One that maybe I wasn't ever born or didn't even existed.
"Can't Help Falling In Love" by Elvis Presley.
Sometimes it snows in April- Prince
Sayonara by Dave Tipper might take the cake for me!

Les Fleurs by Minnie Riperton!
But we all know the real answer is All Star by Smash Mouth
The Carnival is Over by Dead Can Dance
Lord Huron - The Night We Met
Fade to black - Metallica. The lyrics, the acoustic guitar, the guitar solos, the kickdrums. 
 The final guitar solo sounds as someones whole pain put in it, accompanied by the kickdrum that sounds like the last beats of the heart. The lyrics about suicide...
Virile - The Blaze
Pete’s Jazz by Pete Rock
Memories of Green - Blade Runner soundtrack
Familiarity by Punch Brothers
First song comes to mind? Drowning pools - bodies.
Every time I hear the opening arpeggios of Gimme Danger by the Stooges I get goosebumps
I want to know what love is by Foreigner
Mirai e kiroro. The song is just sad and nice at the same time
Every juice wrld song I’ve heard
I don’t know if they’re famous outside of my country, but Rocket Brothers by Kashmir is very beautiful all the way through. The vocal and the story are just.. chefs kiss!

Other than that, Elliott Smiths cover of Jealous Guy (only to be found on YouTube) is a song I think about very often. I don’t know why, but it really strikes a chord with me.

And, lastly, Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley. It gives me so many memories from My youth, and feels so heavy and yet so immensely beautiful.
"Arc of Space" by Bruce Dickinson
Honestly probably Husavik (My Home Town) from Eurovision
Aphex Twin:

Avril 14th

But Blackheart by Twostepsfromhell is just beautiful 0
But I would also consider if I die by Akros beautiful in my standard
We’ll Meet Again by Vera Lynn. Gets me every time.
Probably a weird answer, but a lot of video game music gets me a tad emotional.


C418 - Minecraft is very simple, but whenever I hear it I get sent back to when I first downloaded the game. It’s just so, simple, elegant and peaceful.


I get a similar vibe from “on the beach at dusk” from pokemon mystery dungeon. Just a calm, blissful atmosphere that it gives off.
Running Up that hill cover by Patrick Wolf
I Hope I Think of Bike Riding When Im Dying - Neat Beats

Two VERY different submissions: 
1. Such Great Heights (Joy Kills Sorrow version). It’s beautiful, joyful, and super fun to listen to. 

2. White Woman’s Instagram by Bo Burnham. Something about this dumb fun song brings me a euphoria I can’t explain.
"Veden alla" by Emma Salokoski

I know this might not get popular among mostly US based redditors, being a Finnish song, but my fucking god it is amazing and beautiful.
The Autumn Room by St. Anthony Mann
The Road by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis
Aileen - Mighty Oaks
This is such a hard question, but judging by my current mood I would say "Power" by Isak Danielson
Racing into the night by Yoasobi
On Sight
Aretha Franklin’s version of Natural Woman

Mary Did You Know.  Version sung by Sting
Lord Huron - Take Me Back To The Night We Met
Enter Sandman by SHEL

This must be the place - iron and wine

Sitting on the dock of the bay - Otis Redding

New Soul - Yeal Naim
Saturn- Sleeping At Last, or really any Sleeping At Last songs. Ryan has so many beautiful and soothing songs, and he even wrote a lullaby (literally called "Lullaby") for his baby daughter, which I've added to my sleep playlist. He's done a few songs for movies including "Turning Page" in Twilight, "North" and a ton of other songs in Grey's Anatomy, "Make You Feel My Love" in Station 19, "Pluto (Instrumental) in Five Feet Apart.... He's awesome.
I really can't chose between Foo Fighters - Walk of Michael Kiwanuka - Cold Little Heart (album version).
The Love Version of “While my Guitar Gently Weeps by The Beatles. It’s a beautifully haunting song, it has a basic finger-style guitar laid out by  George Harrison from 68’, and then a complete orchestra with haunting vocals from Harrison himself.
Some off the top of my head… Blackbird by the Beatles, Rainbow by Kacey Musgraves, and To Build a Home by the Cinematic Orchestra

A lot of my favorites have been mentioned (mad world, hallelujah, harvest moon, and many others) and there are so many new songs I have saved and want to experience. But someone down here mentioned Lord of the rings and the two end credits songs for each trilogy have always moved me.

Here's to You by Joan Baez and Ennio Morricone. More and more voices join in to sing as the song progresses. Quite powerful. And the melody is extremely catchy yet elegant.
Adam's Song - Blink 182
Agnus Dei
Deborah's theme from Ennio Morricone.

Blood - The Middle East and To Build a Home by The Cinematic Orchestra. The first is a celebration of death, the second is a metaphor for growth and decline, birth and death. The music video is heavy.

No matter what - Boyzone
Everything You've ever Dreamed by ARIANNE
Window by Albumleaf
Not many will know these.  But “heartbeats” and “stay alive” by Jose Gonzalez. An incredibly under appreciated artist.
Hurt, Johnny Cash
IMO 

Suicidal Love/Numb The Pain by Juice WRLD. it's such a dark song (talks about suicide, drugs, toxic relationships and manipulation) but it always resides with me and I've always felt so much emotion come from that song. all the negative emotions i feel day to day are matched in this song. definitely top 3 best songs he ever made.

(Also, the song is unreleased and you'll have difficulty finding it unless it's on YouTube or elsewhere)
Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty
Within by Daft Punk
Voces8 performing “Underneath the Stars”
Dolores O'Riordan - Ave Maria
‘Something beautiful’ by Tom Walker and ‘The sound of silence’ by Simon and Garfunkel
Untitled #1 Vaka by Sigur Ros. Definitely the song that I'll have someone play at my funeral.
It’s a Bumpy Ride On The Back Of A Camel - Skybox

This song is something special to me. It reminds me that there’s always something good on the horizon.
re: Stacks - Bon Iver. The guitar and vocals are just so peaceful and beautiful
Sasha Sloan: Dancing with your ghost

It just kind of grasps that feeling of losing someone so good.

When the Wild Wind Blows - Iron Maiden
River Flows In You. So many emotions.
A solid contender is: Immunity by Jon Hopkins
Foul Body Autopsy - Necrophagist
Ballade Pour Adeline
John Coltrane’s “Welcome” would be my most recent answer; it’s a beautiful song that fits in well with my recent taste in ambient music. 

The Mars Volta’s “Televators” has always hit pretty hard. The album is about a suicidal artist, and I found it after a friend took his own life. It’s probably the most important album I’ve ever listened to in my entire life. Not the best, not my favorite, but absolutely my most important.

Speaking of songs that helped me deal with grief and loss, Silversun Pickups’s “Lazy Eye” helped me get through my grandfather’s death, and Chevelle’s “Jars” was on the radio quite a bit after my friend’s suicide. All of them remind me of profound loss, but also beautiful optimism.
Vogel im Kafig
Hard to choose but one I'm thinking of is: Aurora-The seed (live for Like a version) on YouTube.
[Waking the Witch](https://youtu.be/ktkRzVEMQCo) by Kate Bush

[I Won't Complain](https://youtu.be/JQ4mFaI17pk) by Benjamin Clementine

Many of the songs I would have picked are already named in this thread. These two do not come up in the search.

This is really fucking hard for me though. Music is cultural and deeply personal all at once; for example, a dear friend of mine passed away about a decade ago. He shot himself. Breaking Benjamin's Dear Agony album got me through it. That album is very dear to my heart, especially the songs Dear Agony and [Give Me a Sign](https://youtu.be/97S66xee0U8). Because those songs are so personal to me, it's hard to be objective.
Christian Island - Gordon Lightfoot
Fall of the Peacemakers by Molly Hatchet. It simply can't be beat as far as lyrics, melody, or guitar leads/solos. Super underrated
Here There and Everywhere by the Beatles
No Consequences by TheOnlyRosa
Light Year Gregory Alan Isakov
See you soon Coldplay
Faux Ed Tullet/Novo Amor
Angel, Sarah McLachlan
Feel fine by Emilie Nicholas

Into Dust by Mazzy Star
Last Goodbye- Jeff Buckley
You say I’m in love - Banes World
Rainbow eyes by Rainbow is probably it for me. Of course the vocals are phenomenal (cmon, it's RJD we're talking about), but just the whole song is so perfect and calmingly sad. And this also applies to Temple of the king by Rainbow and Catch the Rainbow also by Rainbow. Man, dio era Rainbow is just beautiful

Dust on the wind by Kansas is also def up there. I don't know how to elaborate on this because I've just always felt like it's the perfect song - vocals wise, and especially guitar wise (bonus points because I'm really attached to this song since it was the first song I learnt on the guitar). It's just so good.
Lacrimosa but humanity has ended.

*Landslide - Fleetwood Mac*

*What’s Up - 4 Non Blondes*

*Don’t You Forget About Me by Simple Minds*

Beautiful in the sense they always hits me, hard. In the most beautiful way…

It’s “bigger than me” type of vibe, nostalgia-esque feelings come, very spiritual in the sense that upon listening through it touches each individual listener’s soul in its own way. Relatable. Pain & Beauty.
Bruno - from Encanto ….

Konstantine by Something Corporate. The way Andrew Mcmahon plays the piano is just hauntingly beautiful.
Aqueous Transmission by Incubus
Rachmaninoff piano concerto No.2.
Piel canela
The Johnny Cash version of Hurt. Maybe because I’m older, but that one really hits me in the feels.
I hope a weeb answer is okay: [I'm Glad You're Evil Too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLevj9bdRRA). It's about two people believing themselves to be outcasts finding solace in each other and something about that just really gets to me. The music is really beautiful too. It's a 6 minute song but you don't even notice it because the music keeps changing as the song progresses.

The minecraft original soundtrack
Kamasi Washington's The Rhythm Changes
I hear a symphony by Cody fry is just beautiful it makes me cry every time I hear it
Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys. The one line that sums it all up: “I don’t know where, but she sends me there.”
Unironically, The Dismemberment Song by Blue Kid and Lonesome Organist Rapes the Page Turner by the Dresden Dolls

Both songs are about processing trauma; the former being more so about taking power back, and the latter being about the process of brushing traumatic events off while still somehow understanding the gravity of the abuse. 

Both address trauma in a beautiful, but sarcastic and biting way. The nuance I see in these songs seems to be unmatched
Ecstasy of Gold by Ennio Morricone
The Lighthouse's Tale by Nickel Creek
“I left my heart in San Francisco” by Tony Bennett. Grandparents passed and I found their records from decades ago, played this album and the song makes me cry every time.

How’s it going to be? - Third Eye Blind
Movement 6 by Floating Points, Pharaoh Sanders, and the London Symphony Orchestra
Most beautiful is tough, but Everybody Wants To Rule the World has brought me to tears (for fears?) many many times.  

I’ve dealt with suicidal ideation for a good while (it’s fine don’t worry about it), and the line “Welcome to your life, there’s no turning back” really hits me hard. It’s pretty basic, I know.
Danny’s song
Lover you should have come over- Jeff Buckley
Probably my favorite of his albums even though I find it difficult to listen to because it drives me to tears
One summers day sang, from the soundtrack of the movie “Spirited Away” . Made me cry while studying during my YouTube search.

[Oogway Ascends](https://youtu.be/KtMnDmuhKQs) by Hans Zimmer from Kung Fu Panda
“I Dreamed a Dream” from Les Mis.
"Clay", by Goldfrapp

The song, itself, is beautiful. The story behind the song, and WWII relationship and love letter that inspired it make it all the more special.
All The Time In The World - Louis Armstrong
The suite "Five Hebrew Love Songs" by Eric Whitacre (composer), sung by any number of choirs. The BYU choir is a good recording, and the whole suite is only 8ish minutes.  They are so short and so gorgeous, meant to capture those small, precious moments of joy and contentment with a loved one: lying in bed watching the snow fall as the bells of the city ring out; catching a fleeting glimpse of your bride on your wedding day; your love's hair falling across their face just so. I guess if I had to pick, I'd say "Laróv." It means "Mostly," and its (translated) lyrics are so simple:

"Mostly," said the roof to the sky,
"The distance between you and I is endlessness.
But a while ago, two came up here,
And only one centimeter was left between us."
Just check out any of Porter Robinson's music. Each song has a message that makes me feel feels
Regress by The Dear Hunter. Really that whole album is like a religious experience
Hurt by Johnny Cash

Flying dream 1 on Elbow's newest record is up there along with the MTV unplugged version of Nutshell by Alice in Chains
Hmm, there's a few. Hold on to my Heart by W.A.S.P. probably tops my chart. Close second would be a bosnian song - Ne Lomite Mi Bagrenje by Dorde Balasevic.

I Know The End by Phoebe Bridgers
Angel - Tom Petty
 
There’s also a ukulele cover of Nothing Compares to You that was on a tribute album to Sunead O’Conner that I can’t remember the name of the singer but it just hits right)
How dare the premier, ignore my invitation, he'll have to go.
So too the bunch he luncheons with, that's second on my list of things to do.
At the top is stopping by, your place of work and acting like, I haven't dreamed of you and I, a marriage in an orange grove.
You are the only thing, in any room, you're ever in, I'm stubborn, selfish and too old.
Castaway Angels by Leprous
A song that can make me cry every now and then is  [Place To Be by Hiromi Uehara](https://youtu.be/Mf6UNCBy3MA) . Especially the video. Seeing her emotions and passion while playing just does it for me.
In a Manner of Speaking by Nouvelle Vague
Pyramid song - Radiohead
That one song from the animal abuse commercial
…but I should have told you, Vincent; this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.
Champagne Supernova by Oasis
“Gentle Movement” by Royksopp is by far the most beautiful song I’ve ever heard
Rammstein- Spieluhr
Habibi and Indigo Night by Tamino
Byzantine chants. Especially this one 

https://youtu.be/q9Gkr-DQbTw
That song that "Tenacious D - Tribute" is about
Tight now it's pneuma by tool.
To me all fucked up by the amity affliction had the most beautiful meaning to me.  It’s what I needed to hear at that point in time I first heard it.
I’m not religious, but there is a chord in “O Holy Night” that is just magnificent. It’s the A-minor on the word “Fall”.  Just gives me chills.
The xx - Intro. And the cover by City of the Sun
Eva Cassidy's version of Somewhere over the rainbow.
Somewhere over the rainbow. Was my grandpa's favorite song.

Meadowlarks by Fleet Foxes
Saved by The Dear Hunter. I was in the back seat of a shitty car driving through the woods of northern Wisconsin in early July. I was 15, away from my family and Illinois for the first time, working at a camp for the summer. I liked music but I had only really ever listened to the radio or my parents music growing up. I also wasnt very cool back home, I didn't have many close friends and it usually felt like I just kinda tagged along after my older brother. But here I was- driving through the woods at night, surrounded by friends, people who actually liked me, I was exhausted from a week of work but I felt more comfortable than I ever had before. Then Saved came on. I hope I always get remember how that moment felt. Beautiful song.
RadioHead - The Numbers
May it be - enya 

Maybe not the most beautiful, but certainly up there
Fade into You - Mazzy Star.

It's beautiful in a hauntingly sad way. But because it emotes such real human feeling, I find it beautiful. Beware, it lingers like a dark fucking cloud and makes you relisten even though it's a downer.
Begin Again by Andy Shauf
Winter by Joshua Radin. Hits me in the feels every time.
Fairport Convention had some traffic beautiful ones.

'Fotheringay' and 'Crazy Man Michael' spring to mind.

And my final one, 'Brothers in Arms' by Dire Straits. West Wing fans will agree.
Stories by Bill Withers is an extremely strong contender for me, the piano is stunning and I love his voice
Dire Straits - Why Worry
Fadein/fadeout- nothing more.
Onne dich - Rammstien
It may sound cliche, but "September" by Earth, Wind, & Fire is legitimately one of the best songs ever made. 

It brings such a warmth to my soul that other songs simply can't do.
https://youtu.be/IA_ubhYgjAc

Little person. Makes my soul both happy and painfully sad.
I’m not sure how many metalcore fans there are here, but Invent Animate are super good with aesthetic and Luna made me border on tears, especially considering the story behind the lyrics. Highly recommend.
Coming Back To Life by Pink Floyd.
I'm just gonna say the Tarzan soundtrack. Phil Collins went above and beyond.
I am the antichrist to you. Kishi Bashi with the Nu Deco ensemble. https://youtu.be/l_dGqLzOnhA
Moya by Godspeed
"Home" by The Cure is really nice
Common knowledge by Connor Oberst
This is a piece not a song but the most beautiful piece/song I ever heard is Clair De Lune by Claude Debussy
Hallelujah. I scrolled way too far and didn’t find it. Y’all should be ashamed.
Anything sung by Josh Radin
Générique - Miles Davis
Lo de mas, by Cultura Profetica.

This song lives rent free in my brain and was the first to pop into my mind as soon as I read the question.
I have a million favorites, but "lo de mas" always brings about a flood of good emotions and a kick of dopamine that is unmatched by any other.
John Frusciante - Falling
Departure by Phaura, and Eshonai by Aurai
I see a darkness - Johnny Cash

* If This Is a Plan - The Delgados
Probably [this one ](https://youtu.be/N1iTcsHEQMU)
Listened to Real Death by Mount Eerie, followed up with Now Only. Incredibly depressing and powerful songs, but the way in which he seemingly starts to accept his wifes death and his new life with their daughter without her by the end of Now Only and the way he says it is so beautiful. Still horrible and depressing leading up to that moment, but I still found something really beautiful in that ending.
Futura Free - Frank Ocean
I heard Blowing in the Wind again the other day by Peter Paul and Mary and I remembered why it’s one of my favorite anti war songs
Skinny Love by Bon Iver. Personally I prefer a live performance you can find on YouTube instead of the studio version. So much raw emotion
Aesop Rock - Daylight. The chaos of his lyrics that breaks into the calm chorus just makes me want to smoke cigarettes and look out the window https://youtu.be/7HEq8UqrujM

Or True Dreams Of Witchita by soul coughing .. https://youtu.be/ID-DEJryG8M
https://youtu.be/L70zDHBjt4c (Mama, Terra Naomi, from the early days of youtube)
Surf’s Up by The Beach Boys is amazing
Harvest Moon by Neil Young is a top pick for me
Some Day We’ll Linger in the Sun by Gaelynn Lea
Nutshell - Alice In Chains
“September by Earth, Wind & Fire ” and “Black and Gold by Sam Sparro” . Something about these track that always hits for me
The The - Uncertain Smile
Sights - London Grammar. 
 Lorelei, Pandora for Cindy - Cocteau Twins. 
Zeit ohne welt - Brook Band. 

All of them are so Beautiful
“Gabriel’s Oboe” from the movie “The Mission”
Remind me 2 days
Ik im late but Anima by the re:plus bandset is just beautiful
"In the skies" by Peter Green
Other choices are already listed, but I’ll add Phoebe Snow’s “Poetry Man” to the playlist.
Bird Song by Grateful Dead
King of Rome by the Unthanks. Makes a grown man cry.
Nude by Radiohead. Or maybe Alien Manifestation from the Nier Automata soundtrack. Both are haunting. I also love All is Full of Love by Bjork.  I like dark moody lullabies lol.
"Plaisir d'Amour" - Joan Baez
Arriving Somewhere But Not Here by Porcupine Tree
Ebudae by Enya
Letterbomb, green day
Kamado Tanjiro no Uta from Demon Slayer. It might have been the animation in that scene, but fuck me that was amazing. Straight onto my Spotify playlist for sure.
Rain Song - Led Zeppelin
Space Song by Beach House. Or their song, On the Sea.
Ometh - After the burial
It's an aggressive metal song but the solo and lyrics give me shivers. Especially when I saw them live.
I’m extremely fond of “The First Hunter” from Bloodborne. Given the context of the song, you would expect something grandiose and epic. But instead, you have a very slow, sad song carried mostly by two violins. Later in the track, a choir joins in, following the melody of the violins and it is beautiful and also heart wrenching at the same time.
Amoureuse by Kiki Dee

Without You by Nilsson
This is prolly gonna seem lame to most of you but I really think Yellow Ledbetter by Pearl Jam is beautiful...especially when Eddie Vedder says "make me cry" to Mike McCready and then he McCready plays that short but absolutely beautiful solo.
April Rain - One Is Glad to Be of Service
you're gonna live forever in me - John mayer
Wicker woods and candle wax by Amélie Farren is a surprisingly underrated song ngl
Simple as This by Jake Bugg - first dance at my wedding!
Something Holy by Alice Phoebe Lou
Orinoco Flow by Enya
Video games - Lana Del Rey
The Real Folks Blues from Cowboy Bebop. I always tear up when i hear it. And also waltz for zizi from CB is also beatiful although it is purely instrumental
Words - Passenger
I know it may sound cheesy but Jeff Buckley’s cover of “Hallelujah” is just other worldly.
Weight of the World/End of YoRHa, from Nier: Automata

Without posting any spoilers, for such a deep game I don't think they could have made the end credits music any better. There's something about the buildup of the music, the chorus, the mixing of English, Japanese and French-esque lyrics that make it such a perfect and emotional piece to finish off the game. I've played a lot of games in my life, but Nier: Automata is what I consider one of the five games I've played that wasn't just fun, but a privilage to play, and a big part of it comes down to the music.
I can’t make you love me - Bonnie Raitt Beautiful in a heartbreaking kind of way

Not a song as such, but a fantastic piece of music. Some soft piano and deep percussion.
Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone) by Chris Tomlin
A nonsense song my little girl was singing the other day while playing.
Rain - Jon Heintz. It's the song they used in the show Deadliest Catch when Big Phil passed away as a tribute and it's an amazing melodic rock dirge and sad anthem, just beautiful. I want that one at my funeral, If I get one.
"[Gays 4 Donald](https://youtu.be/uX9HfGwomBk)" by Joji on Pink Season
The Cure - Treasure

Hands down....I cannot hear it without a montage of people I've lost running through my head...and can USUALLY smile by the end.
Righteous
Woods - Bon Iver
Stay by Lisa Loeb
More of a recent work but Sufjan Stevens’ Wallowa Lake Monster is sublime and perfect song for winter
Changes - Charles Bradley.
Dosed by Red Hot Chili Peppers
Kara Kara Kara no Kara
“I Remember Everything” by John Prine is the most beautiful, sad song. Last tune he recorded before he passed which is extremely fitting.
There are many great songs here. But i haven't seen this posted yet:

[Kid Francescoli - Moon](https://youtu.be/fdixQDPA2h0)

It also has a beautiful music video.

Wind of Change - Scorpions

My Silver Lining - First Aid Kit

The Man Who Would Speak True - Blitzer Trapper
There are way too many songs for me to mention but mine and my husband's wedding sing was Glitter In The Air by Pink. I've felt alone for a good majority of my life, I've had a traumatic childhood and I've always felt alone. That song touched my heart years ago and resonated with me on many levels and I felt alone in my own little world, just wandering through life til I met my husband. He anchors me and makes me feel loved. It's the first time in my life that I felt that a human wanted me in their life. So it's a reminder of where I was before I met my husband of 11 years. Plus, I adore Pink's music.

Balls in your jaws
[Humming Chorus](https://youtu.be/0f1k14GQmNE) from Madam Butterfly.
Chan Chan, Buena Vista Social Club.
There are so many but I find ''softcore by the neighborhood'' to be an absolute masterpiece, brings out a million emotions out of me at once.
I have never watched the show it’s from, but I would have to go with Secondhand White Baby Grand from Smash. I don’t think I’ll ever stop crying
Rainbow Connection from the Muppet Movie
I instantly thought of One Last Wedding - Thad Kopec.
Must’ve been said already but “Ludovico Einaudi- Nuvole Bianche” mixed with a sunrise or sunset and some happy thoughts will make you cry.

Gymnopédie No. 1 - Erik Satie

What Sarah Said - Death Cab For Cutie
It’s almost impossible to say which is the most beautiful song I’ve ever heard. Princess Leia’s theme by John Williams absolutely has to be one of the most beautiful songs I’ve ever had the pleasure of listening to. I’m not even a huge fan of Star Wars, not as much anymore as I’ve grown up, but God damn that’s an emotional work of art.
Just because it hasn’t been said yet:
Runaway - The National.

First dance at my wedding and a favourite memory.
TIME - HANS ZIMMER

no words. Always makes me get emotional
There is a song called “Galileo” by an Irish guy called Declan O’Rourke. It is just beautiful. I think Josh Groban did a cover of it but not nearly as good as the original. I urge you to you tube it

So simple, but done with such emotion that it sweeps you off your feet each time.
Right in two , tool
Jin roh soundtrack theme song.
Undying by Demon Hunters.

It stuck to my heart, as my grandfather died a year or two before I heard it.  It spoke of how heartbreak and deaths will always be inevitable, but at the final moment, you shall see them again in the next life.

He may not be my grandfather by blood, but he’s certainly my grandpa.
Josh McBride by The Head and the Heart. It’s sad, but definitely a beautiful song.
S.O.B by Nathaniel Ratliff and the Night Sweats. Really, that entire album is glorious.
There are four songs that I think are perfect. “Yours” by Russell Dickerson, “Past the Point of Rescue” by Hal Ketchum but I prefer Celtic Thunder’s rendition better, “Hurt” written by Nine inch Nails and sung by Johnny Cash, and “Suicide is Painless” by Johnny Mandel. Those four songs have gotten me through a lot.
Crimson and Clover by Joan Jett & the Blackhearts. Also Forever Free by W.A.S.P
[Appalachia Waltz, Mark O'Conner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajkgNEO_Yeg) Makes me feel outdoors and relaxed.

This may be weird… but Test Drive by John Powell from the How To Train Your Dragon soundtrack is superb and damn near leaves me in tears every time I hear it.
Coldplay - Life in technicolor
Aqueous Transmission by Incubus. After a heart wrenching break up, it truly helped me heal and move on. I'll always have love for my ex, but we could never be those people again. Understanding that through the scope of music really saved my life a few years ago.
I really dig two covers Eva Cassidy did - Fields of Gold and Time After Time. Amazing voice, tragically lost too early. Beautiful, beautiful stuff.

“Civil War by Guns n Roses”

Such a haunting journey you go through as a listener, listening through..

Especially when it gets to the end: *What’s so civil 'bout war anyway?*
Southland in the Springtime, Indigo Girls.    I'm surprised this isn't played as somber music at funerals.

Also, notice that she says "drinking coffee black," not "drinking black coffee--" that's part of the poetry of it.  It's qualitatively different than the rest of their catalog.

I and Love and You
KSI - Holiday (Don’t flame me it’s actually a really good chill song with good vibes)

Edit: The Manchester Orchestra - Silence. Is one I should add that is the most beautiful with lyrics

Maggot brain by Funkadelic.

"Maggot Brain" was recorded in one take when George Clinton, under the influence of LSD, told guitarist Hazel during the recording session to play as if he had been told his mother was dead:
Clinton explained "I told him to play like his mother had died, to picture that day, what he would feel, how he would make sense of his life, how he would take a measure of everything that was inside him."

You really appreciate this song even more when you're tripping, but it's beautiful nonetheless :)

Not the most beautiful by my favorite beautiful song is Pollen by Ecco2k, it’s written in Swedish.
Feel a bit silly admitting this, but Sebastian Yatse (sp.?) *Dos Oroguitas* is the most beautiful, heartbreaking song I’ve heard in years.
River Flows In You by Yiruma and Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd
Bitter Sweet Symphony - The Verve
Howard Shore's Concerning Hobbits, [especially this compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGk8WA608qM).  It's the most peaceful, hopeful music I have ever heard.  I love to listen to it.

I'll also add [He Lives in You (Reprise)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGPMCKH1siQ) from the Lion King on Broadway because when I saw it in theaters, I felt so much emotion that I wanted to weep, shout, and cease existing all at the same time.  However, it doesn't evoke those emotions outside of the theater.  Still, it is the most intense experience I have ever had with music.
Love the way you lie or "What could have been" from Arcane.
Flower Duet from Lakmé
Youth - daughter

Definitely this one: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0LihkvdjQQw
Don't Fear the Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult
"Green Eyes" by Erykah Badu. One of my all-time faves. It switches up about a dozen different times and takes you on an emotional journey that is palpable. If you've ever found yourself holding onto to a relationship for dear life, you'll feel this song.
Sing About Me, I’m Dying Of Thirst by Kendrick Lamar. 
Every single verse, bar and word on this song just absolutely pours passion and love. This is the most personal Kendrick has gotten on a song and you can tell. Brings me tears every time I hear it, especially at the line:
“And if I die before your album drop I hope…(gunshots)”

Aalon: Magic Night.
Kate Bush - this woman’s work.
Konstantine by Something Corporate
Harness your Hopes - Pavement and California Dreamin'- Mamas and the Papas. They make me feel nastolgic for a summer that never exsisted in the first place

Frank Ocean is an all time favorite and “Siegfried” is beautiful. It’s my most listened too song of all time according to Apple Music

The song played in Nook’s Cranny in the last 10 minutes before it closes.
Emily by Stephen Fretwell (great surname too)
Circles by Mac Miller is SO GOOD MAN.
For me, it has to be I Didn't Understand or Pitseleh. Both of those cut me deeply.
Comfortably numb and Little Wing are both neck and neck for me
Jaded by deadmau5
Bang
sorry i can’t pick one

in my head - peter manos

 maps-freya tidings (cover of yeah yeah yeahs)

blue eyes- cary brothers

slow dancing in a burning room - john mayer
Jude-didirri. His train sessions version is amazing but in general this. Absolutely beautiful song
Some Mother’s Son - The Kinks. It’s a song about boys in WWI and the mothers who love them, and the line “but in his mother’s eyes he looks the same,” always makes me cry.
Joy by George Winston. The first time I heard it I felt such a rush of optimism and a feeling of all the good things possible in life.
Surely someone knows 'Perpetuum Mobile'?

Brings me not to my safe space within myself but to emptiness. For it is a place you're in. With nothing to loose, and no more to win.
Bill Withers - Hope She’ll Be Happier
Without a doubt, it's this one dude who i came across in a reddit post a few years back. He made a piano song called 

short stories no.1 Blue Coffee


Something about the song just hits every single note in my brain, Here's the link if you wanna give it a listen. :)


https://youtu.be/ROLGQBWOnh4
*That Next Place*, by Thomas Newman, from Meet Joe Black, featuring Sir Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. Absolutely phenomenal soundtrack. 

*Everyting gwarn be irie.*

IMO people are sleeping on a lot of movie soundtracks.
I'm going to say Mojo Pin by Jeff Buckley. Lyrically, it's beguiling (gonna take a guess and say it's about humping), but Jeff does his vocal pyrotechnics thing and elevates it into something jaw-dropping.
Rachel's- water from the same source

Hands down the most beautiful song I've ever heard. Just devastating. 

https://youtu.be/OcE8YWdGtnI
How to disappear completely by Radiohead genuinely makes me cry

Newton’s First by the Altogether. That song has the greatest lyrics of all time in my opinion
Babys -Bon Iver
Wicked Games - The Weeknd
I have a really hard time deciding between 

since i left you by the avalanches

Ripple by the grateful dead
Thirteen - Big Star
Enternal snow
Either Plastic Soul by Mondo Cozmo or Tuscan Sun by Atlas Gray.
I Giorni.  Ludovico Einaudi, Angele Dubeau & La Pieta

The broadest imaginable sweep of both lulling and passionate melodies.  Einaudi and Dubeau never fail to help me make it through the worst of days.
[Ocean - John Butler](https://youtu.be/jdYJf_ybyVo)

Such an evocative song, though I have to admit, it doesn't bring the ocean to kind for me. I've always envisioned a mountainy forest setting.

Either way though, the guy is a legend with the guitar. God damn
Det som en gang var by Burzum. Or really any song off of Hvis Lyset Tar Oss
Some mountain goats shit tbh
Free Bird - Lynyrd Skynyrd
The End by The Doors
I’d probably have to say ‘Uso To Honto’ from Your Lie In April, although ‘Kyne’s Peace’ from the Skyrim Soundtrack, ‘La Forza’ by Elina Nechayeva and ‘Lovely’ by Billie Eilish and Khalid are also such beautiful songs but all for very different reasons
Be our guest from beauty and the beast with a Dolby Atmos surround sound system

That’s How Strong My Love Is by Otis Redding 

I’ll be your rainbow when the tears are gone,
Wrap you in my colors, and keep you warm.
Radiohead - Reckoner
Les Fleur by Minnie Ripperton. A singular, once-in-a-lifetime vocal talent that could effortlessly sing in the whistle register and created a language for flowers. She died before her time, at only 31 years of age, but not before leaving the world both her music with songs like Loving You, but also her daughter Maya Rudolph.

Simple Man - Lynyrd Skynyrd
A womans work - Kate Bush
Ok, it's impossible for me to single out the most beautiful piece of music I've EVER heard... but, if I had to choose one right now on the spot, I'd probably go with Mahler's 8th Symphony - specifically the [Finale](https://youtu.be/9WhNn6zxqVg). The buildup into 3:25 is just simply transcendental.
I didn’t understand - Elliott Smith
“Lover, You Should’ve Come Over” - Jeff Buckley

The lyrics just get me every time.
Aurora's cover of Massive Attack's Teardrop. Oh my god
Explosions in the sky - your hand in mine
Into my arms - nick cave and the bad seeds
Marina-To be human
For me it is: Where is my mind - The Pixies

https://youtu.be/InyT9Gyoz_o

I love all kinds of music from all genres but that fact that instrumental music is so universal, it has no language and it can make you feel so much-- I couldn't possibly pick any other type of song. I couldnt choose just one because both of these are incredible~
I can't name only one, so here are 3

You will be OK (Stolas' Lullaby) by Sam Heft
A Sky Full of Stars by Collision Music and Epic Music World
Under Cherry Blossom Trees by Neeks
Green, Joni Mitchell
j'en ai marre - alizée
Hazy Shade of Winter, The Bangels.
Came out when I was in high school, after a tragic event in my life and it's always given me the feels.

Edit to add that I also love the version by Gerard Way with Ray Toro for Umbrella Academy!
Hello Scotland - ef
The Night We Met - Lord Huron

Allentown - Manchester Orchestra and The Front Bottoms
To Live is to Die by Metallica

Especially about 4:30 onward. This was the last song written by their bassist Cliff Burton before he was beheaded in a bus wreck. This is the only song off this album with audible bass. It's very long but worth a listen. It's entirely instrumental except for the the poem that Cliff wrote being read by the singer James Hetfield toward the end
Kingfisher- Joanna Newsom
Melting - Isao Tsukamoto
One more night - Wolfskind
Ocean - John butler
"Ocean" by the John Butler Trio.
A little more indie but I really like "a big day for grimley"
Ends a album on a (high?) Note

Edit: actully a lot of AJJs (the people who made the song above) album endings are quite beautiful
Friday by Rebecca Black.  

It's catchy, I love Fridays and the part that makes it beautiful is that this girl showed the strength,  despite so much criticism levied against her,  to continue on pushing the song and being the face of it. 

I wish I shared the same courage. It's inspiring and I really wish more people looked at the song with a more open mind, because when you consider her age and how difficult it is to put yourself out there at that stage of life.. it really does cement it as one of the songs of our generation. 

Did I mention it's catchy as hell?

Swing Lo Magellan - Dirty Projectors
Shostakovich - Piano Concerto No. 2: II. Andante
A Song For You - Donny Hathaway
Lets fall in love tonight by Lewis Baloue
Sextape - Deftones… or even Entombed by Deftones
Con te Partiro/Time to Say Goodbye is always so moving
"Vissi d'arte" sung by Maria Callas. Back when opera was done to perfection. It's something straight out of a dream...a melancholic, languishing dream. There's a video of her singing, and the way she opens her arms to lay her soul bare during the emotional climax.... I dont recall a song I've wept to out of its sheer beauty quite like that one
[Liebestraum no. 3](https://youtu.be/nkXOrkeZyqQ) by Franz Liszt.

"Don't Lie To Me" by Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Thirteen by Ben Kweller
1. “Changes” by George Lightfoot. 2. “Crimson and Clover” by Tommy James and The Shondells. 3. “Vienna” by Billy Joel. Bonus: “Foreplay / Long Time” by Boston might not be conventionally the most “beautiful”, but gives me more  spontaneous energy than any other song.
Sleep. 

Marie Claire / Conjure One.
Lights out, words gone. Makes me cry every [time](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=duBN7YZyIwU).
Benediction by The Weakerthans, a beautiful song that tears me up for some reason I cant explain.
Claire De Lune. A song doesn't need lyrics to be absolutely beautiful
Entre dos Aguas - Paco de Lucia
This thread - tell me you're white, without telling me you're white. Yeeshhhh, where's the rhythm and blues, the soul? It's all old white man music. 

Michael Jackson, Billie Jean.
Stevie Wonder, Superstition.


Theyre my picks.

Unless I need to say something by The Beatles and Bob Dylan, jeez.
True Faith-Lotte Kestner (the ending song from the last of us part 2)
“For the love of god “- Steve vai
Sing by Travis
Aurora by Hans Zimmer
Among Us In Fortnite 2. This song had the grace of a broken chair, and speed of ordering a cheese burger at McDonalds. I broke down into tears after hearing the first verse, not that the song spoke to me personally, but because I burnt my chocolate milk in the air fryer. I cried, but Among Us In Fortnite 2 reminded me that I'll always be able to own up to my mistakes, and shoot my fridge 32 times with a 9mm handgun for fucking my wife. 

12/8: wouldn't recommend
[“How to fight loneliness” -Wilco](https://youtu.be/7CAYFIpi89k)
Evenstar by Enya, LOTR soundtrack
Literally every single song by Zach Bryan
Nothing Compares 2 U - Prince

Kanye West - Street Lights .. edit: mobile won’t let me put these each on their own line
[Simply Red - Holding Back The Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EKWE0BgyL4)
Late to the party, and I'm gonna skip my usual answers (but if you want to look them up it's Beethoven's "Pathetique" and "Home" by Bob Harris...that one will be hard for you to find) and go with...

[Jason Isbell - Letting You Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6alzZQXi7Y)

I got to walk my daughter down the aisle a few years ago.  This song was not out yet, but if you are a dad who is looking for the perfect "daddy daughter dance" song in the future?

This is the one that will make you cry tears of joy as you're dancing with your kid at her wedding.
Ray LaMontage...absolutely anything!
This is going to get buried but Dry Flower by Yuuri is legitimately the prettiest, most heart-touching song. Even if you aren’t a fan of Japanese music, even if slower melodic tunes aren’t your cup of tea, give Yuuri a try. His voice in this song conveys so much emotion and it’s a great story song as well.
James Vincent McMorrow - Cavalier
I am going against the grain here, but will add a song in Spanish: Te para Tres, by Soda Estereo. Translated, it's called tea for three. At first, if you only kinda hear it superficially you figure its about a love triangle. But the song is really about the time Gustavo Cerati's parents (he was the lead singer) sat him down for a cup of tea to tell him his father was dying of cancer. It's such a moving song.

Also Torna Sorriento, an Italian song about a mother pleading with her son after she learns he died during the night during a shipwreck (her son was a fisherman).

And right this very moment, I am really into Gokden slumber by the Beatles... I have always been a Let it Be fan, but this one hits me differently now.
In this moment, the first song that comes to mind is At Seventeen by Janis Ian.

And Rain City by Turin Brakes.
Speak life- Damian Marley.
Crywolf - CEPHALOTUS
Nessun Dorma
Like Someone In Love by Bill Evans
Aviators - monumental
Both sides of a smile, james blake and Dave!
Hide and Seek - Imogen Heap
Hurt (Johnny Cash) and Hallelujah (Cohen) would have to be the top for me. Some other contenders: 

Angie - Rolling stones 

Paint it Black - Stones 

Carpet Crawlers - Genesis

Biko - Peter Gabriel

The Stranger - Billy Joel

Thick as a Brick - Jethro Tull

Libertango (I've seen that face before) - Grace Jones

Tonight - Elton John (actually a lot of the blue moves album)

Song for guy - Elton John (Single man was a pretty good album to)

Wrong side of heaven - Five finger death punch

Bleed - Tapping the vein
Flowers from 1970 is a huge favourite of mine
Nit exactly classy or modern (infact its from the 69s and you probably won’t like it) its called pearls in her hair by omega  it is originally in Hungarian but i don’t remember the name of the original
The Partisan by Leonard Cohen
Wicked Game — Chris Isaac
Fox Stevenson - Ether
Beautiful Girl by Spacehog from their 2nd album. Not widely known, but a beautiful, haunting track and the power in Royston Langdon's vocal performance always gives me goosebumps as it builds towards the end of the song
Take Care - Beach House. I cant remember where I found it but whenever I listen to it I'm filled with uncontainable love for my best friends.
Heart of Darkness-Sparklehorse
The Chicken Cow by Wesley Willis
Come Down by Sylvan Esso
The Alan Parsons Project - Old And Wise
Say Something by A Great Big World.  The video makes it so much more as well.[Say Something](https://youtu.be/-2U0Ivkn2Ds)
The way of all flesh - Gojira
The "Marry Your Daughter" Cover by Adera.
Walk you home -Horrorshow

Intimate and personal song with an amazing backstory. Solo (rapper) wrote, recorded, and sent the song to his first love who the song is about after their breakup. Then when preparing to release the album the hard drive he recorded it on crashed. They had to re-record the song for the album. Only the girl who the song is about has ever heard the original.

The lyrics and the song are slightly cryptic because they refer to specific moments of their relationship the listener is not privy to. Although the listener will never understand 100% of the lyrics the feeling of falling in and then out of love for the first time is an experience many people have and makes the song incredibly relatable and beautiful.
Probably Veridis Quo or Something about Us.

Several already mentioned but a few that come to mind:

[the reason expensive headphones were made](https://youtu.be/V2gMXJEqt3c)
Charles Bradley does a cover of Changes by Black Sabbath. I can't not cry. I'm a 31 yr old man.
Viva La Vida by Coldplay is up there for me.
My fiancé who I guess now has left me, used to send me videos of her playing the guitar and singing. I would listen to them over and over and I would show them to anyone who would hear it. She hasn’t sang in so long.
There is - Boxcar Racer
Okay I know I already commented but Wherever You Are from the winnie the pooh movie hits way fucking harder than it has any right to as an adult.
Turning Page by Sleeping At Last.
Btw, any of all the songs by this band are so so soothing.
La Dispute by Yann Tiersen.
Wake Up Everybody by Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes
Untouchable - Anathema
England by The National. Always has and always will be my favourite song.
JumpOutTheHouse
Gold Dust by Galantis. 1st time I heard this song and I was just mesmerized by the melody, bass all of it. And its kinda like a serenade. And its an EDM song. 

Another beautiful song that I recently been listening over and over is Street Runner by Rod Wave. 

Be Blessed Ya'll
Mairi Campbell and Dave Francis- Auld Lang Syne

Come to life - ye
Hallelujah, Jeff Buckley

The Flower Duet from Lakmé

The Bones of You,  Elbow

And genuinely a song written by my ex who is a musician. He never released a recording of it, but it is truly spectacularly beautiful.
Traveling Soldier by the Chicks. I listen to mainly alt rock, but that is one of the most beautiful/perfect songs I’ve ever heard

IMO of course
Transgender by Crystal Castles
Hallelujah. Most versions, but I recall this one hitting hard https://youtu.be/BG-_ZDrypec
O'Carolan's farewell to music. Every version is just so hauntingly beautiful and bittersweet.
An ending (ascent) by Brian Eno. A really emotional song for me.
Rainbow eyes by Rainbow.
Tenacious D - Master Exploder
Maybe some Ukrainian(?) funeral song I have sadly lost. Folk stuff, not catholic. There was a haunting version in youtube where maybe 10-15 people sang as a choir. Sounded something like "bernoisii kariveli" but my memory is fading more each year. Really should have downloaded it as I haven't been able to find that again and I try like once a year...
Crosby, Stills and Nash - You Don’t Have to Cry.
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms as performed by Iris DeMent for the 2010 True Grit. The most hauntingly beautiful piece of music I have ever heard.
Three Libras - A Perfect Circle.
Creel Etude by Clark. Absolutely beautiful.
Surely Elton John, Your Song has to be worth a mention!
skeleton key by origami angel
Live forever - Oasis
drops of jupiter is the best song of all time and i will not be convinced otherwise
Dream Sweet In Sea Major by Miracle Musical.
Autopsy of the devils brain- Flaming Lips
Bittersweet symphony
Probably not one that will get a lot of attention but English Rose by The Jam. Very much a song version of the saying “home is where the heart is”.
Wake Me Up When September Ends. A beautiful song with a sad and meaningful background
Ghost Love Score - Nightwish with Floor Jansen Live, at Wacken, 2013.
Anyone who has listened to it at least once will immediately understand why.

https://youtu.be/JYjIlHWBAVo
Wax fang song will look up name layer
Nils Frahm - Says. I don’t know if it will still have the same effect on me now as it did when I first heard it, but that one gave me goosebumps so many times. Also Jose Gonzalez’ cover of Heartbeats. And Neil Young - Cortez the Killer.
Stop Dogging Me Around by Jackie Wilson. His voice is beautiful.
Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis - Ralph Vaughan Williams
Strawberries by Caamp
Jenny by Nothing More. The arrangement, vocals and breakdowns are amazing but the first time I actually focused on the lyrics I broke down in tears. This is the first song I could actually relate to when it comes to the subject of someone close to you who suffers from drug/alcohol addiction(for me, it’s my little brother, who’s name happens to be Johnny)
strawberry swing, coldplay
Melding by Marika Takeuchi
Melodies of Life - Final Fantasy IX
In the aeroplane over the sea
Every James Blunt song

Intro by the xx. Gets me every time.
Rainbow kitten suprise -Painkillers
Bittersweet Symphony-The Verve.  It reminds me of an absolutely amazing friend that we lost a few years ago.  But if it weren’t for him, I’d never know the song.
Radiohead- Subterranean homesick alien
Disturbeds' cover of the sound of silence.
Sia - Breathe Me and Lamb - Please
Welcome to the Internet - by Bo Burnham
It's a real toughie to choose just one, but the first song that came to mind was Nutshell by Alice in Chains. Layne's lyrics reflect perfectly his state of mind at the time and are so easily relatable. Dark and brooding, I love it lol. A close second would be AiC's MTV unplugged version of Brother - can't beat those haunting harmonies from Layne and Jerry to penetrate the soul and give you chills. I can't comment without mentioning Forget Her by Jeff Buckley. Actually the whole Grace album is perfection. Oh man, more songs and artists keep popping into my head, so I will stop now.
Queensryche - Silent Lucidity
Just Breathe  - Pearl Jam
Don't Fall Behind- Springsteen (Wedding song with my late husband. He had the song all picked out way before we were engaged. I had never heard it before, I can't listen to it now. He's so missed.

"Un Suspiro" on piano
Riviera Paradise- Stevie Ray Vaughan
“Found god in a tomato - Psychedelic porn crumpets” might be a change of pace from the rest of the songs but it’s an incredible song from a great Aussie psych rock band
Psychostick - NSFW
Nuvole bianche
All the diamonds- Bruce Cockburn.                                         Orpheus- Sarah Bareilles.                                     One- U2 feat. Mary J Blige                                    The Bulgarian State Television female choir- Love Song( Polegnala e todora) seriously chillingly beautiful!

Hit me right where it hurts as I'm struggling with issues of my own.
This Mortal Coil’s cover of Kangaroo is spectacularly lovely. Also Featherweight by Fleet Foxes. And the Bookends Theme reprise by Simon and Garfunkel. How can I pick one when there is so much beautiful music in the world?
Voilà- Françoise Hardy. I cried the first time I heard it.
The Night We Met by Lord Huron
Pure as snow by MONO is great but you could pick any song from that album. A wild river to take you home by black hill is song I also find very relaxing.

Midlake - Core of Nature
Andrea Bocelli, Sarah Brightman - Time To Say Goodbye
Cat People
By David Bowie
[tool - right in two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bndL7wwAj0U)

doesnt quite fit with the rest of the song posted here so far but there is something about the way that it "flows" that makes it something special IMO.
I’d throw Mirrorball by Elbow into the mix. Guy Garvey has an amazing voice.

Rejects in the attic by the avett brothers- live version
Vanilla Twilight - Owl City
After Dark - Mr.Kitty
Rebecca Black - Friday

Cam’ron- Touch it or not. I send it to my girlfriend when I’m feeling romantic
Délivrance by Alcest, no doubt
For me it’s Whitewash by Buckethead, or Everybody Here Wants You by Jeff Buckley.
Last year I got a new job and moved away from my family for the first time. I was working overnights, bringing people from the hospital back to nursing homes or to their homes. A lot of times, it's hospice patients. And it had been a day of people who were really, really close to going. At 7AM on a Saturday, I drove home, and two songs shuffled through my playlist. First was "Lullaby of London" by The Pogues, which is on it's own an absolutely gorgeous song about distance and loss. And then "This Year" by the Mountain Goats, which is a phenomenal song about an incredibly brutal topic. So I spent part of that Saturday morning, half asleep at a park along the Mississippi river.
Shibuya by Covet. There's something about Yvette Young's playing that feels so smooth, it's like calm waves coming over me
Lazarus by Porcupine Tree
Deep cut here, but The Orphan by Newsboys

Even if you aren't a believer, it's still a beautiful song.
Hooverphonic -Inhaler

https://youtu.be/lphG4o2tOn0

Do You Realize?? - The Flaming Lips
A warm place - NIN
Vermilion pt2 and snuff by Slipknot. Just so great, I think the contrast between other songs by Slipknot in terms of melody and pace just makes it feel more special, sort of in the way that if a quiet and gentle person is pissed, he's really pissed. In this case with sadness
November Rain by Guns ‘n Roses
Damn, that was hard!

For me it's three songs, sorry, I just can't decide. They are beautiful in their own way.

Chris Cornell - You know my name: I really believe it's just the epiphany of the whole Bond franchise and Chris's voice here is really something else.

Linkin Park - Castle of Glass: I always cry when I hear this song - and mind you that I saw the video only one year after I heard it the first time. This sound of being small and unnoticeable from one of the biggest persons in music is strange yet beautiful. I miss both of you a lot

Burial - Stolen dog: this one is just a vibe song for me, when I feel melancholy, this really is the best soundtrack of all time
Encoder by Pendulum 

Sums up my love life
Sitting on the dock of the bay- Ottis Redding
Just something about it hits differently
The Last Goodbye - Billy Boyd

Even though The Hobbit Trilogy wasn't well done, the music and this song were still amazing. It's also the first song I listened to after my cat passed away, so I tend to cry now most times I listen to it. Also Billy Boyd has an incredible voice.

Edit: I also really need to add this one:

Per Te - Josh Groban

Josh Groban's voice is like silk.
https://youtu.be/n6oSeODGmoQ

Gaelynn Lee. Literally cannot listen to her sing for more than 5 seconds without crying and I'm a 29 year old man.
My immortal by evanescence
The Greatest- Cat Power
In My Life by The Beatles from the album Rubber Soul
After browsing through the most upvoted songs, Reddit is just middle aged women with cats. Got it.

A lot of people have already posted some of my favorites. One I haven't seen mentioned yet is Soul Meets Body by Death Cab For Cutie. That's a beautiful song.
Kelpaat kelle vaan - Juha Tapio

I don't know Finnish yet, but I have heard the Sanni version of the song a bunch before without understanding the lyrics. One day I found the Juha Tapio version, and it made me curious what the words actually were. I looked them up and actually cried. This happened when I waa going through a difficult time recovering from heartbreak.
Wings for Marie, Pt 1 and 2 by Tool
Probably clouded due to my love of the Lord of the Rings trilogies, but Billy Boyd - The Last Goodbye
Mary by big thief, was a very beautiful first listen to me. It's definetly not one of my favorite songs, but it somehow brought me into a very calm state when listening to it for the first time. Definetly a very beautiful song.

Digital bath - Deftones

Stardust by Spanky and Our Gang
A Winter's Tale -Queen

Blue in Green by Miles Davis (Kind of Blue album)
Tsubasa wo kudasai. From the chorus, the lyrics, the music; it perfectly represents the desire to be free from everything.

Symphony No. 9 4th movement. Need I say anything else? The anthem of humanity united under joy, brotherhood, spirituality, and love.
Nothing else matters. It will always be my favourite song.
Taillights fade by Buffalo Tom
Space planet - Orbital trance
Can't tell by thaiboy digital
First day of my life - Bright Eyes. 

Cheerful tune, lyrics have a lot of heart.

WAP
Open Your Eyes by Alter Bridge

I love the live versions of this song. It gives me goosebumps.
Ambergris by tipper
It's more about the mood I need in the moment, than an objective best.

One of my top contenders is "The Price" by Twisted Sister. 

I've always loved the sound of hair-metal, and a song that resonates with anyone that has had to learn what they have to sacrifice to attain the goal they were chasing.
[Hymn of the Cherubim](https://youtu.be/OPlK5HwFxcw) \- Tchaikovsky

LOTR soundtrack
Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton, especially the Unplugged version
King Crimson - Starless And Bible Black
Deftones - Sextape
Invincible - Tool

Not sure if others find heavier music beautiful, but the entire album Tool released in the last couple years is fucking gorgeous to my ears. Fear Innoculum, Pneuma, and Invincible are all amazing. Each are nearly 10 minutes long, though.
On Some Faraway Beach by Brian Eno,  So many others of his I could put but this one always gets me
Fly me to the moon
I really enjoy Ave Maria. Not really a religious person but that song gives me chills.
Little Wing-Jimi Hendrix
In Ear Park - Department of Eagles
“Mother of Pearl” by Roxy Music, “Sorrow” by David Bowie, and “New Slang” by the Shins.

Labi Siffre - my song
Close to the edge by Yes

It's a masterpiece.
Twin Falls Idaho by Ron Pope.
Debussy - Arabesque No. 1
I really like "stop this train" by John Mayer. As someone in my mid 20s I just relate to a lot of the lyrics and it's a really pretty song.
Golden slumbers by the Beatles
“What’s Going On” by Marvin Gaye
Re: Stacks by Bon Iver
Blue skies by Blue October
I've dealt with pretty severe depression most of my life, there is a line in this song 
(I wanna be that ocean
I want to shine like that
I want to smile so big my daughter jumps into my lap
And I wanna tell her daddies fine and always plans to be
Then take her in my arms
This is what we'll always see)
Legit makes me tear up just about every time I hear it My daughter turned 5 this last December, I can say with certainty that for me, there have never been truer lyrics written
[Into the West · Annie Lennox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvF31-2bVNE)
Paulo Nutini - Iron Sky. The Abbey Road Live Session is sensational.
Even when he is silent composed by Kim Andre arneson. It is a choral piece adapted from a poem found in a concentration camp
Forever - Kari Jobe
On the Nature of Daylight by Max Richter. It’s in the movie Arrival, among others.
Philippe Jaroussky - Vivaldi Aria, an operatic piece
Love Song - The Cure
When I first listened to Enya. Just in the beginning but I thought it was surreal.
Last Train At 25 O’ Clock by Lamp
Travelin’ Soldier - The Chicks
Whiney - Oxford road
Can't say like in "forever" but at the moment it's "what could have been" by Sting and Ray Chen, off the Arcane Soundtrack. Watched the last episode yesterday and immediately recognized stings voice due to my utter hatred of it (Roxanne and some others were the "please wait in line" music on a job related Hotline I had to call every second day for about 2 years, so I developed a dislikening to his voice in total) 

This one is built different and I love it.
Ice Dance by Danny Elfman as part of the Edward Scissorhands soundtrack.
Sukiyaki
“Vincent” - Don McLean
“Piano Sonata 14” - Beethoven
in my dream
Barry Manilow— All The Time
Stranger on the shore - acker bilk
dream land- third world
On the Nature of Daylight is very pretty IMO
a river flows in you , Yiruma
Beautiful by Eminem
The Rain Song - Led Zeppelin
I don't remember the name but there's a handsome guy singing that he's not going to give you up, like... never!!! Hands down best song ever
It's a little overplayed at this point, but when I heard "Falling Slowly" by Glen Hansard for the first time ever, in the movie (without having any prior knowledge about the song or the movie), man did it make me cry.
nice!!!
First that came to mind that I haven't seen mentioned: The Luckiest by Ben Folds

Trent reznor - hurt(unplugged);
Maybe not conventional beauty i guess lol, but it has beauty in the pain and emotions it evokes
[Bad Skin Day](https://youtu.be/cP0BASQRqlM) by Bell-X1
Whale and Wasp - Alice In Chains. For when you want to feel all of the feelings alone.

Release - Pearl Jam. For when you want to feel feelings no matter the situation.
Con te Partiro by Andrea Bocelli
Ylang Ylang by FKJ
The Moon Represents My Heart by Teresa Teng - only asians will recognize this but this has to be one of, if not the most beautiful song I've ever heard.
You'll be in my heart by Phil Collins
Guns and Roses: Don't Cry.
I'm stuck between these two songs. Very heartfelt and emotional songs. Very well done. Shawn James has many other songs that are just as good, if not better imo, but the one listed seems to be the most "accessible", for lack of a better word.

Rake by Shawn James

Brothers In Arms by Dire Straits
Your soul by Forrest
A Change Is Gonna Come - Sam Cooke
The new title song from the Killers - Pressure Machine.  Bravo.
"Rabia Dulce" by Rubén Jordán. Sadly, this is the best version of the song I can find (so angry at that audience for interrupting). 

https://youtu.be/1X-Ch4W-sPo
Song of Unborn by Steven Wilson

For a long time I carried a lot of guilt about leaving my children’s mother while they were still so young. The lyrics of that song said so many of the things I wanted to say to them. I’ve always had a great relationship with my kids but this song still gets to me. I can’t listen to it without tearing up.
Phantom - Of Monsters and Men

Old song written by Nanna before the band formed. Really speaks to the time when you aren't sure about where you are in life.
My immortal by Evanescence 

Somewhere only we know by Lilly  Allen.
“Leader of the Band” by Dan Fogelberg
[Loona: Hijo de la Luna](https://youtu.be/uwosbctPjoQ)

[Julian Casablancas: 11th Dimension](https://youtu.be/pl15PlIXHIk)

Can't decide between these two.
The Trailer Park Boys intro song. I can't explain it. It makes me so sad and so happy and just feel at home. I live in halifax so, maybe that's it
We've Only.Just Begun - The Carpenters

Actually anything by The Carpenters: Superstar, Rainy Days and Mondays, and Close to You. Karen Carpenter's voice was just pure velvet. She was gone too soon man.
led zeppelin-stairway to heaven
Shine on you crazy diamond is good. As well as breathe, echoes, or marooned by Pink Floyd.
Mr. Telephone Man by New Edition or Wild Thing by Tone Loc
Sound of Silence - Disturbed cover
Video Games - Lana Del Rey
Move on now by Hard-Fi
Palace - Live well. This song gave me hope when I was at my lowest, will always be grateful.
Africa by Toto. Best song ever created
_Sound of Silence_ by Disturbed.

While this is a cover song, I just love this version from the very first notes. And the build up is just perfect.
Somebody to Love by Freddie Mercury.
Iris by Salyu.
You most likely haven't heard of it.
Go give it a listen.

Falling by Angelo Badalamenti.

Common People by Pulp.

Can’t Hardly Wait by the Replacements.
Lovin’ You by Minnie Riperton. She had such an angelic voice & it’s such a sweet song. It always makes me so happy when I hear it!
Some epic song by Nightwish
“Reckoner” - Radiohead
Tiesto's remix of As the Rush Comes, by Motorcycle. For some reason its not listed in his discography.

It is beautiful in such a way that it can calm me down, put me to sleep, or make me feel that things will be okay. Truly one of his greats, in my opinion.
Across the Stars
The Passing Light of Day, by Pain of Salvation. Many songs can give me chills, but this one is magic. Like a time machine. I close my eyes and I can feel the same things I felt the first time it played on my car speakers.

For that particular reason, I don't allow myself to play it that often.
the color of anything - james blake
you without and end- deafheaven
mayonaise- smashing pumkins
maud gone-car seat headrest
are some song that have been inlove with for a really long time.
Nothing else matters by metallica

November Rain - Guns N’ Roses
Wood kid - The Golden Age feat. Max Richter "Embers"

Do yourself a favor and watch the whole video, the intro is different than the (awesome) rest. Only really starts at 1:36.
I've said this in a similar thread, but it's worth mentioning again.

Radical Dreamers from the Chrono Cross OST. Sung by Noriko Mitose. So good.

Sufjan Stevens Mystery of Love.

So many good responses in here.  Pink Floyd, Damien Rice, Jeff Buckley, The Weight, John Butler, Elvis, The Shins...so many others.  Great responses reddit.    
    
I'll throw in another for the hell of it.  [The National - About Today ](https://youtu.be/Ef1nJWtkprU)    
    
I really like Bob Schneider's [2002](https://youtu.be/P_Uh68FEVY8) as well
Never gonna give you up
Aikea Guinea by the Cocteau twins, Liz Fraser has an unbelievable voice.
Music Without Words by Joe Satriani.
[Swan Lake - Tchaikovsky](https://youtu.be/9cNQFB0TDfY) (i love how it starts so beautifully and then it turns out so dramatic, the story behind it it's also really pretty)

and

[Butterfly - BTS](https://youtu.be/Z4o7-6cFUF8) (it's about the fear of losing someone you love. Someone had interpreted it as a boy falling in love with a suicidal girl, i found that really touching and heartbreaking, the lyrics are really pretty)
Time. It’s perfect
"The Matador" or "Tiny Glass Houses" both by Amelia Curran.
Sorry if already said but Divenire by Ludovico Einaudi. Modern classic style. Generaly many of his stuff is touching soul with beautiful melody
I personally really like mr 'crowley' but that's because of the solo.
I also like 'running out of time'
u/remindme 3 days
Black label society - in this river.

Gives me the ole goosebumps everytime, and the meaning behind it all

And...

Slipknot - Snuff
Best part by Daniel Caesar
Seu Jorge’s cover of David Bowie’s, Life on Mars?. 

You can even say that his entire Life Aquatic studio session album should be on there, but hands down best rendition of Life on Mars?.
Most beautiful..? Prob some Japanese song off an anime movie liKe Your Name or that new one... “belle”
I don't speak spanish but this is up there for me

Andrea Bocelli - Por Ti Volare

You may know it from Brennan's rendition at the end of Step Brothers
"Llorando" by Rebekah del Rio from mullholland drive

Or "cristofori's dream" by David Lanz
Oblivion by Halfy and Winks
Chances by The Strokes
The garden of everything by Maaya Sakamoto and Steve Conte
Exile by Enya is one of those ones.

Also, Bring Him Home performed by Alfie Boe? *chefs kiss through tears*
„Where have you been, my blue eyed son“
Fart (reverb) + (slowed)
Undertale, by Toby Fox.
*Harvest Moon* - Neil Young    
*Achilles Come Down* - Gang of Youths
Maybe Nude - Radiohead ?
Knights in white satin by the moody blues
The Donnie Darko soundtrack
Suo Gan from the film Empire of the Sun
A lot of people have probably heard of Gregory Alan Isakov but a song of his that I don't ever see mentioned is "This Empty Northern Hemisphere". I love the way the song builds slowly throughout.
Someday - Julia Jacklin (Triple J Like a Version). I thought The Strokes original was amazing, but this, just hits way different.
Surf Curse - Freaks
To Make You Feel My Love - written by Bob Dylan. A lot of versions but I think Garth Brooks is my favorite. I get chills when I hear it. Also Evergreen by Streisand.
Anything sung by Andrea Bocelli
Excuses - A P Dhillon
Isaac - Fragments by Bear's Den. Isaac was already a beautiful song by itself, and I couldn't give any summary that would do the meaning of the song justice, but in a very butchered attempt, it's about the hardships and conditionality of fatherly love. Then Bear's Den released a collaboration with Paul Frith, who added a classic ensemble, and I get goosebumps every time I hear the Fragments version with the classic piano and the strings.
A lot of Bear's Den songs have very deep meaning that can hit close to home. Loss, disease, depression, abuse, addiction, all positive and negative aspects of love. It's beautiful in its brokenness.
Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb.
November rain is the most beautiful song ever I herad
Any colour you like, Pink Floyd
So many to choose from:

I hung my head - Johnny cash
Spanish Sahara - foals

To Build A Home - The Cinematic Orchestra ft. Patrick Watson

you ever heard a duet between an opera singer and a rapper while feeling inspired and pump at the same time?
[Aphex Twin - Rhubarb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AWIqXzvX-U)
Changes by Tupac. A lot of struggle and pain, but it’s the most beautiful song I’ve ever heard.
For me it's a toss up between Claire de Lune by Flight Facilities and Hanezeve Caradhina by Kevin Penkin and Takeshi Saito
O rubor sanguinis - Hildegard von Bingen
Corral Nocturne and Quiet City by Aaron Copland. Those are two of my favorite classical pieces I’ve ever heard. If you can try and find the Cincinnati Pops records of the songs. In my opinion they have the best records of the two songs but I’m sure any other orchestra is just as great
Hello by Adele.
Sunset Lover by Petit Biscuit
Ben E. King - Stand by me
Trouble by Cat Stephens. So beautiful and heartbreaking.
land of honey - flying lotus
Junius Jakob Fridfinnson by Grant McDonald
No Strangers To Love/ Want you by Roy Ayers
John Taverner's 'Song for Athene' still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up when it hits the crescendo towards the end. Similarly, Allegri's 'Miserere' does similar when the soprano hits the high note. 

I would pay money to hear this in a church as it was supposed to be performed, with the tenors placed around the space. Enlightenment surround sound! I heard it done this way in a concert hall which was great but not quite the same as a medieval church would be.
Fool's Overture by Supertramp
[Peter Gabriel - Book Of Love](https://youtu.be/c2j4lA-E7Vc)

Of course, first time I heard this, was Craig and Tweek. Watched that scene a few times, I mean... if it can make that heartwarming, well... yeah. The song is legit.

 Sometimes, I think I'm just too old and I'll spend the rest of my life the way I spent most of the rest of it, just me. But songs like this, make me wonder... maybe, you know. Never know. Maybe I'll dance this time.
Claire De Lune by Claude Debussy
Radiohead - Idioteque.
[Gary's Song from Spongebob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCoN16zdM08)

Just Breath - Pearl Jam

Maenam - Jami Sieber
I'm not sure if the whole song counts, but the vocals of the song "Monody" by Fat Rat are freaking heavenly. It also has some amazing composition.
Blur-Sing
Hoppípolla by Sigur Ros

No idea what he’s even saying but it makes me cry

It was beautifully played in the Synder Cut Flash scene. I cried and bought the song immediately.

Steven Wilson - Drive Home. 

That solo by Guthrie Govan is etched on my soul.
Probably Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd, the absolute best and most beautiful guitar solo in all of rock!!
I recently discovered "Donna" by Ritchie Valens and it is simultaneously the sweetest and saddest song ever written.

For context, "Donna" was about the then-17 years-old Ritchie's girlfriend who's Dad refused to let her see him on account of him being Latino. They fortunately made it work despite that.

Unfortunately, Ritchie Valens died a few months later along with Buddy Holly and The Big Bopper in a plane crash, which would be known as "The Day The Music Died".
Sometime around midnight
I'm partial to this remix of [Hatikva](https://youtu.be/FdGNY8rf-Og).

Check out this playlist on Amazon Music: beautiful songs
https://music.amazon.co.uk/user-playlists/b84d50a12c7b436bac0e93511ec2b106engb?ref=dm_sh_cbs2gv33ZEJyRPfL0H3gnjMiI
Taswell by C418. Best heard while looking at some great scenery.
My contribution:

Queen Jane song - Oscar Isaac

It’s from the OST of the Coen Brothers’ movie *Inside Llewyn Davis*. And it is gorgeous. The entire soundtrack is filled with wonderful indie/folk tunes performed by absurdly talented actors/actresses singing their own parts, just like Isaac, who is phenomenal in a heartbreaking and self-destructive role. But the music…man.

Go listen to it.
Dear Wormwood by the Oh Hellos. There’s a section at the end that sounds downright holy, like there’s a divine revelation that happened, and it makes me feel almost want to be religious again. It really sounds like overcoming pain and learning to love what you value in musical form, which is exactly what it’s going for - it’s about getting past abuse. On the other hand - Two by Sleeping at Last. It’s a song about unconditional love and it’s a different kind of holy where everyone is wholly human and better for it.
Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers - Something Good Coming
There is a lot, but i love to heard platinum old music like, The Wonderful sound by tom jones
Sun King by the Beatles
Anything by Vaughan Williams sounds beautiful.

But for this playlist, I would say Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd.
Hoppipola - Sigur Ros. It's never NOT beautiful.
Kathy's song - Simon and Garfunkle, though it is just Simon. The most beautiful love song I have ever heard.
You needed me-Anne Murray
I know it's over by The Smiths, Waterloo Sunset by The Kinks and Piledriver Waltz by Alex Turner.
Song? Little Wing.

Instrumental? Either Morning Mood by Edvard Grieg or Ocean by John Butler.
Your Song - Elton John
Fields of Gold
Pursuit of happiness
Hedonism by Skunk Anansie.
Keith jarret Koln concert. 
Number one best selling of all time.
Bat out of Hell
Jefferson Starship - Miracles (the long version: 6 minutes 58 seconds long)
Dust in the wind
"Spin me right round" by Dead or Alive. This song is literal dope. Gets better every time you listen to it.
Northern Sky by Nick Drake

I never felt magic crazy as this
I never saw moons, knew the meaning of the sea
I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
But now you're here
Brighten my northern sky
Sigur Ros - Staralfur
The Trapeze Swinger- Iron and Wine. One of the most beautiful songs I’ve ever experienced.
vivaldi four seasons
Together We Will Live Forever - Clint Mansell from "The Fountain" soundtrack.
An interesting choice, especially given I quite love the calming melodies to more serene music, but I'd have to go with "Give Yourself A Try" by The 1975—it's always what I listen to when I fall into depression and want out. One among many keeping me alive.

Better yet, the voices of my loved ones. Not music per say, but always beautiful to hear. Fear I take 'em for granted and should tell 'em I love 'em more often. Take care, everyone!
The long and winding road
Magical stuff.
Oh, and because, the anthology 3 edition... The Beatles are otherworldly sometimes....


Enya Aniron is also beautiful, that voice is something else, hits deep.
The slow piano ballad I heard when I died for a few minutes was hauntingly beautiful and sad.
Im sure its somewhere already mentioned, but for me SEBASTIEN TELLIER - LA RITOURNELLE, and its cant get any more beautiful than that.
My kids think I'm weird because when I hear Beethoven's 9th Symphony I have to choke back tears.
You’re the one - The Black Keys
Star Spangled Banner, THAT’S RIGHT!
Shanghai Restoration Project ft. Zhang Le - The Wondering Songstress
Postcard from 1952 - EITS
I just called to say I love you by Stevie wonder

bardasht by Aliakbar Shekarchi 

Bye bye Charlie by henry Mancini
Rylynn by Andy McKee
Supermarket flower, by ed sheeran. It had come out about a time when my nan died and I was closer to her than my parents. I've openly cried over that song it resonated with me so much and I rarely cry in years .
Adele did this recording of When We Were Young

https://youtu.be/DDWKuo3gXMQ

Blows me away every time. Between the power of her voice and me relating to the song, it's one that gets me every time

[Good Riddance - Hades](https://youtu.be/e05ClTDW9F4)
Tuna in the Brine - Silverchair
Equilibrium- Mana

It’s a 16 min long epic instrumental of a German pagan/folk metal band. It’s really incredible, feels like a journey through a Fantasy world
Anyone said shine on you crazy diamond yet?
Rosalia- me quedo contigo, live
https://youtu.be/N6PxslE7q5A
Remind Me- Röyksopp
Calum Scott you are the reason idk man it’s just beautiful

I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it - The 1975
Dont like how i havent seen it yet, Brain Dance by Animals As Leaders. Wow
Hum - Adult Jazz

Ultimate slow build that never quite pays off how you'd expect. Goes to some beautiful places tho.
Kissing You by Des'ree. Best know from William Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet (1996), something about the arrangement, and particularly the violin, just make this burly beardy man melt.
“Che Si puo fare” by Barbra strotzzi, and “Vaga Luba Che inargenti” by Bellini are heavlinly
The only living boy in New York - Simon and Garfunkel
So many. You’re Mine by Lola Marsh is top of mind.
I actually have 2, both from video games:

The first "Succession of Light" from Monster Hunter Wolrd: Iceborne. Never fails to make me cry, though that may be in part due to my attachment to the game.

The second is "In Your Belief" from Asura's Wrath. In a game with insane over-the-top action, this song is probably the best. Might not be as great by itself, but it's so much better during the few key moments it plays during the game such as [here](https://youtu.be/3Q2buuDfGxQ) and the [ending](https://youtu.be/a_AbqoSDW5U). (SPOILERS obviously)
Space Song - Beach House
Ride, also Orpheus by David Sylvian

Clair de lune or what a wonderful world from Louie Armstrong
St. Ides Heaven, by Elliot Smith
Wings for Marie / 10,000 Days - TOOL

The Feel Again (Stay) - Blue October;
Fiddler’s Green - The Tragically Hip;
Every Stranger’s Eyes/A Moment of Clarity - Roger Waters;
Oceans Apart/Part of Me Died - Roger Waters;
Sara - Fleetwood Mac;
Moments of Pleasure - Kate Bush; 
In Praise of the Vulnerable Man - Alanis Morissette;

There may be more that I’ll probably remember at the most inconvenient time!
Arlington by The Wailin' Jennys. Though it was exceedingly hard to choose just 1 song by them. Relatedly, Pockets by Mark Knopfler and Ruth Moody.
About Today - The National - when I watched the movie Warrior, I cried like a baby. It fit so perfectly.
My December by Linkin Park
I must admit, reluctantly that Whitney Houston cover of I will always love you is the most beautiful song.

However my favorite song will always be Forever Young with Alphaville, but I wouldn't call it beautiful.
Beethhoven - 9th symphony Coral

Sigor Ros - Ara batur

Rufus Wainwright - hallelujah

J. S. Bach Cello suite no 1 in G Major

Come to think of it, it’s her birthday today.
Happy Birthday Em!

Weight of the World from the Nier Automata soundtrack. Listen to all the covers too. Oh god it's so good.

The sweetest thing (I’ve ever known ) Juice Newton
Hummel gets the rockets by Hans zimmer
Wichita Lineman - Glen Campbel
"Linger" by the Cranberries
Albatross by Fleetwood Mac is right up there for me. My dear departed dad loved it and I used to play it on repeat a lot of nights, even before he died, to help me sleep.
Check it out if you've never heard it.
I’ve decided that this is an impossible question to answer. I have a Spotify playlist of all of the most beautiful songs I’ve ever heard and it’s a very extensive playlist.  Many of the songs in these comments are on my playlist.
Malo - March of Progress .

.

Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen

La Campanella by Paganini

Long, Black Veil by Johnny Cash
Nessun Dorma - Pavoratti
X Japan tears
Tunak Tunak Tun
Probably not the *most* beautiful song I've ever heard but I just discovered [Cold, Cold World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaYEVKBCk1c) by Blaze Foley. I'm not much of a country fan but this inspired my to learn how to play it on my guitar. Reminds me of the music of New Vegas which I loved.
10,000 Days (Wings Pt. 2) by Tool. The lyrics are so heartfelt and emotional and are sung perfectly. The slow build up of tension over like 4 minutes to the big release, oh my God. One of the very few songs I know that can actually give me chills.
In the end - royksopp
The Noose by APC
"Eternity: Memory of Lightwaves" - Final Fantasy X-2
Flyin’ High (in the friendly sky) - Marvin Gaye

Tu Jhoom by Abida Parveen and Naseebo Laal.

It's a Pakistani-Punjabi song but it's meaning is super philisophical and deep. The song relates to almost everyone.
Elephant Gun by Beirut.
Tears in Heaven - Eric Clapton
Moonwalking - Late Night Alumni
It sounds like a starry cosmic sky.
Gabriel's oboe by Ennio Morricone. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7w-IeNR9ko
Baba Yetu by Christopher Tin, featured in the album *Calling All Dawns* and the main theme of *Civilization IV*.
Innerbloom - Rufus du sol
A lot of songs off In the Aeroplane Over the Sea used to make me cry. Particularly Two Headed Boy and Oh Comely.
Basically anything that comes out of Aimee Mann's mouth. He songs are so beautiful and he voice is one of the best.  She's completely underrated.  Should be up there with Adele with such a unique voice. I honestly can't pick a favorite most beautiful song of hers. There's too many great ones.
Vincent by Don McLean or Nocturne Op.9 No.2 by Fredric Chopin. They are equal in my opinion.
Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton

The music is great but try thinking about going through what he went through with your own kids while singing that song. Literally broke down and cried while driving home the other day. Life is precious. Hug your kids and tell them you love them.
Damn, there are actually so many good answers to this question, but "Delta" by Crosby, Stills, & Nash comes to mind. Not even really my style of music, but the first time I heard it, I was awestruck.
Patrick Watson - The Great Escape
The Pink phantom by the gorillaz and sir Elton john
Trouble by Cat Stevens
Elsa’s Procession to the Cathedral
True Colors. Heard it a million times before actually reading the lyrics.
Holocene by Bon Iver

My Sweet Lord - George Harrison. Gets me every single damn time!
Medicine Hat by Pond
Curls by Bibio. Such enchanting music, I had it on repeat for weeks.
Father and Son by Cat Stevens. 

That or George Michaels version of Let Her Down Easy.
[Vladimir Miller's rendition of Pavel Chesnokov’s “Do Not Reject Me in My Old Age."](https://youtu.be/5tfmrUnC1zo) Basso profundos are criminally overlooked, and there's none better than Miller. I know this is likely to get buried, but if I can introduce even one person to the wonder of oktavists, I'll be happy.

This piece is an old man's lament, as the title suggests, but specifically it's inspired by Psalm 71. Though I'm not a Christian sort, let alone a Russian Orthodox sort, the beauty of both his singing and this passage stick with me.

*Do not reject me in my old age. When my strength is spent, do not forsake me. 
For my enemies speak concerning me, and those who lie in wait to ambush my soul conspire together and say: “God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is none to deliver him." O my God, be not far from me, O my God, make haste to help me.*
“Passing Afternoon” by Iron and Wine
Cheriimoya - Living Life, In The Night

Aurora - Runaway
Breathless by William Prince
Caruso the violin version
[This live TV performance of Jóga by Björk ](https://youtu.be/QcJj9lBqjuY)
I heard Time For Me To Fly by REO Speedwagon at an odd time in my life. Happened to be quite reflective of my situation and how I felt. Great song nonetheless. Love me some Speedwagon.
Most beautiful girl in the world by prince. In fact most songs by prince fire the question.
She's Leaving Home - Beatles

That song is so heartbreaking and beautiful. It can still make me cry.
Down To My Last - Alter Bridge.
I could name several but an unconventional choice is Fiddler on the Green by Demons and Wizards.  The fact that it is based upon a true story and Hansi's voice is just *chef's kiss
Allison by Slowdive. I still get chills when it comes on.
The Seikilos Epitaph. A song that is over 2000 years old and still relatable. It brings me to tears every time I listen to it
Little lies by Odie
Unforgettable by nat king cole
Love Will Keep Us Alive by the Eagles, solo Timothy B. Schmitt. Brings me to tears. How do I get the Spotify playlist?
Tears in heaven maybe?
The dance by Garth Brooks
Wicked Game - Chris Isaak
Dvorak new world symphony movement 3. 
Or Gliere horn concerto movement 2
Dead can dance - The host of seraphim
*note to visit later

Here’s the link: https://youtu.be/rqs4AoALKE0
Both of these are too good. I can’t pick between them. 

Helvegan - by Wardruna
https://youtu.be/FnkTuHP9q3o

Vor Í Vaglaskógi - by KALEO
https://youtu.be/Da5qQD_RpEQ
Barber's Adagio. If you know, you know
I don't know what it is, but "Paris 1919" by John Cale makes my heart happy. It's powerful yet soft at the same time.
Toto - Africa…just a peaceful song
[Dark On Me by STARSET](https://youtu.be/yntDx4Y4baw).
“It’s called: Freefall” by Rainbow Kitten Suprise, i relate to it and it’s simply beautiful, the emotion in it is perfect
El Triste- Jose Jose
The writer of the song wrote it about the loss of his mother. Jose Jose sang those emotions into the listener.
Revolution by Philip Gardiner

It's one of my Favorite pieces
On two occasions, my wife has flown to a different country for work..

Both times I heard a song on the radio on the way back home that made me cry, as a grown man.

The first time... We had been engaged for about 6 months and she took a work opportunity abroad, I left her at the airport, and Bruno Mars' 'I think I want to Marry you' made me pull over.

The second time was nearly 8 years later, we were not in a good place as a couple, but working through it, she travelled for work and just as I was pulling into the garage in our apartment 'If the world was ending' by JP Saxe and Julia Michaels hit me like a tonne of bricks.

I think 'beautiful' music depends entirely on your state of mind. I watched an episode of 'explained' recently on Netflix that highlighted that every human society on earth has formed music, even remote tribes separate from modern civilisation.. And not a single animal species understands it in the same way we do.

In that sense... All music is beautiful
Here Comes the Sun - The Beatles
Deadhead by Devin Townsend. I feel like this piece by him is him overcoming addition and finding love in life without drugs. Great music all around.
But It's Destiny.
If I have to pick one: Nina Simone - Wild is the Wind

But contenders for 2nd spot: 
Damien Rice - Delicate
Zero 7 - Distractions
Portishead - Glory Box
Thievery Corporation - Claridad
Christina Aguilera - Walk Away
Corinne Bailey Rae - Like a Star
Air - Playground Love
“Mike Oldfield - Tubular Bells” hits different for me.
Kacey Musgraves - Rainbow
Ain’t no way - Aretha Franklin
Come into My Arms - November Ultra. It's only a minute long, but it's so hauntingly beautiful and brought me to bawling. It's like receiving a warm hug after years and years without one.
i know this is a popular answer in most replies to "best song" questions in this sub but In My Life by the beatles is so beautiful. the first verse is so vague and intriging, youre like what's he going on about? and then boom it's a love song. and the music is so damn sweet. makes me cry every time. best love song. goddammit.

i also think hannah hunt by vampire weekend is super beautiful.
The Last Song by Elton John
Concerning Hobbits — Howard Shore. To honest, the entire LOTR soundtrack is a gold mine but this particular track is just simply wonderful.
Faux Tales - Atlas
Impossible to pick but thanks the the Beatles being crammed down my throat on Disney + I will say "Something". Ringo Starrs' du du du dun drum bits are simple yet sooo amazing. The refrain makes the song,  like so many refrains do.

Also for no particular reason "How to Disappear Competely" because anybody who knows it will know why.
Eres Tu by Mocedades, Spain’s entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 1973. https://youtu.be/naAC37W42ro
The Graveyard Near the House by The Airborne Toxic Event. It's a beautiful story.
Sigur Ros - Untitled #3
I won’t give up - Jason Mraz
Answers composed by Nobuo Uematsu, arranged by Tsutomo Narita, with lyrics written by Yaeko Sato and Michael-Christopher Koji Fox, sung by Susan Calloway.

Song to the siren by this mortal coil
Charlotte Church, Pie Jesu. Maybe it's a time and place. I had never heard of her. Her first album just came out. It was at one of those old Fred Meyer listening stations. Her name has "church" in it and the album is called Voice of an Angel and the cover says she's a 12 year old Welsh singing sensation. Like, what the fuck is this shit, right? I thought it was some religious garbage. Hit play just to see how bad it really was and I shed a tear right there in the store.
Floating by Roberto Cacciapaglia
White Squall, Stan Rogers
Pet sounds - beach boys

Weird Fishes by Radiohead
Super late to the thread but Love's Theme, from Star wars soundtrack
Heart Cooks Brain, Dramamine, or Baby Blue Sedan by Modest Mouse. all are their own level of sad, but some of the most beautiful music that’s ever been put out there. I think they show the true depth and core of MM.
Late to the the thread but I love "Into my Arms" by Nick Cave
Never Love An Anchor by The Crane Wives
or

What a wonderful world by Louis Armstrong. Its taught me to appriciate the smaller things even if they don't happen every day.

Both sung by Dallas Green.

For me definitely "Just a feeling" by The Marias.

He does it so well.

Beautiful. Sad, but definitely beautiful.

"Deference for Darkness" from the Halo 3: ODST soundtrack 

It's a beautiful piece of soft jazz, and melancholic notes. That was playing while, in the game, you are alone, traversing a burning city at night in the rain looking for your teammates.

And that song perfectly displays those emotions and it's become an iconic song for the game to this day!

I know this will get buried, but 'This Land' by Hans Zimmer is the most beautiful piece of music I've ever heard. I know I have a bias towards the movie it's from, but I think I'd love it regardless.
"Nude"/"Big Ideas(Don't Get Any)" by Radiohead.

It was played many times live, but never had a proper studio recording until "In Rainbows." It's beautiful.
Black - Pearl jam.
These Are The Days and Irish Heartbeat by Van Morrison.
10,000 Miles by Mary Chaplin Carpenter.
Exist for Love by Aurora.

Someday We'll All Be Free - Donny Hathaway
Kalandra- boarders
I’ll try and weigh in with a couple I haven’t seen yet: 

Stand by Me - Ben E King (this just be on this list somewhere and I’ve just missed it)

Maybe new contribution: Heaven by PVRIS. The piano version is very nice but the original has a dreamy feel to it that’s amazing.
The shooting company of captain Franz B. Cocq - Ayreon.

Maybe not the most beautiful traditionally, but this one does it for me.
Song to the Siren by This Mortal Coil (or one of the original versions by Tim Buckley)
Devil that I know - Jacob Banks 

Beautiful melancholy track about a couple debating if the relationship is worth it or not. The simple piano over the track and Jacob’s haunting voice. It’s simply just an amazingly beautiful song.


Blackbird - The Beatles, a very famous one, simple guitar with a solo McCartney singing over a track. The inspiration coming from hearing a blackbirds song while in India, and another from growing racial tensions in the late 60s.
Mojo Pin - Jeff Buckley. 

I heard this and began dreaming about him (yeah cringe whatever) but it’s the only time I’ve ever heard music in dreams. My dreams are normally silent so it was fascinating to me. I’ve never dreamed and heard music again. 

They say in life you run out of firsts and stuff isn’t as cool as it once was. I find this to be painfully true. I wish I could experience discovering that song again for the first time.

Beach house - Space Song

Song To The Siren by This Mortal Coil
Capsize - Frenship & Emily Warren 

From what I can tell song was originally about love and losing someone, however personally the whole song relates to my fight with depression from a couple years ago. 

Some lines that resonate:

How could you have ever known, if I never let it show (never really wanted to tell anyone about being depressed as I didn’t want to burden anyone) 

Here it comes with no warning (you think you’re fine one moment and the next you just feel like you don’t know what’s wrong with you and you’re just alone) 

I’m first in the water, too close to the bottom, right back where I started (too close to the bottom at times felt like I’d never get over being depressed , and anytime I thought it got better just went back to being the same rigbt afterwards hence right back where I started ) 

I’m swimming up against the tide (always just felt like an uphill battle or swimming upstream, always fighting against my own mind. 

Sorry for making this long, but just never had any other song resonate with me the way this song does. And the crazy part is maybe no one else would hear it the same way I do , everyone would have their own meaning to the song .

Magnolia by keshi. Also, “if you’re not the one for me who is” by keshi. Most of his music is soft and chill, I love the vibe.
“Raise the dead” by RAIGN 
Something about this song aways gave me goosebumps...
Ara batur - sigur ros

Vocal by Madrugada.

Sky Blue - Peter Gabriel, headphones on
Coming Down - Anaïs Mitchel (and the Bon Iver cover is just as incredible)
take everything- mazzy star

Procol Harum - A Whiter Shade Of Pale
To be loved by Adele. It hits me in all too real places and she belts out her heart I the last 2 minutes of that song!
Nutshell - Alice in Chains
I don't know how Finlandia isn't at the top of this list. There are many songs that I like more, but I've never heard anything that comes close to its beauty.
Victors piano solo from The Corpse Bride, Experience by Einaudi, or Promise by Ben Howard
See the fire in your eyes from Red Redemption 2.
That's a hard question, probably Chopain Nocturne Op. 9
Xerrox Isola - Alva Noto is very high up on my list!
Unchained melody by the righteous brothers
At the moment I’d say “Common Threads” by Bobby McFerrin is way up there. Also Biebl’s Ave Maria, depending on who’s performing it.

Backbird - The Beatles

Have you ever seen the rain - credence Clearwater Revival
Max Richter - Spring 1

Loads of people have added On the nature of Daylight but for me there’s something about Spring 1 which just makes my hairs stand on end
As of late?

Probably a tie between "We Don't Talk About Bruno" and "Waiting on a Miracle" from Encanto

As for all time... That goes to the Vanessa Mae cover of The Devil's Trill. Talk about chills.
"Khwaja Mere Khwaja" by A.R. Rahman. I don't even speak the language but I could listen to the song all day.
https://youtu.be/xl_dI-wfYeI  

especially the chorus.

Boadicea -Enya

One Day Like This -Elbow

Praise You -Hannah Grace



Any song done by London Grammar. Maybe check out their song,  Lord Its a Feeling, first

Catch the Wind by Donovan.
NIN - Leaving Hope
Just Wait - Blues Traveler.
Portal - Lights

Bitter-sad melancholy from the master of techno and electronic music.
Cody Fry's Orchestral version of "I hear a symphony"

[https://youtu.be/H3v9unphfi0](https://youtu.be/H3v9unphfi0)

I offer Melanie, Lay Down.  1970 written after Woodstock.

https://youtu.be/IZ52lk9wjZI
Samuel Barber - Adagio for Strings
Comptine d’un autre été : L’Après-midi - Yann Tiersen
Hallucinations - pvris
Nothing culturally impactful, but Ribs by Lorde. I remember going on a drive with an old friend, and she played it. Needless to say, it’s a simple little pop song, but it hits.

Recently going into my 20s, everyone you know it’s getting older and going there own ways, it’s a song I find beautiful
Con te partiro (time to say goodbye) - Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman. Gives me goosebumps every damn time
Cecilia Bartoli - Sposa son disprezzata 

Liking mainly alt music as Nick Cave, Radiohead and shit, this song just lets the world stop for 5 minutes. 

Close your eyes and imagine the foggy Italian country side at sunrise while sipping your first espresso.
Friends - Levitation Room
Pink + White - Frank Ocean
Shadow of a doubt by sonic youth is up there for me
Bittersweet symphony - The Verve
Muse - Hysteria
I don't know but something about the solo always bring me to tears. It's like a mania-depression thing to me.
"I'll tell you someday" - Plini

I discovered Plini when my Dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer. My Dad was a guitarist in a band with my mom before I was born, I learned guitar because of him. My Dad loved Plini's music as much as I did and it's the last thing we bonded over. There's a lot I'm still dealing with relating to his passing, and that song just kinda puts this hope in my head that someday I'd be able to share everything I feel about it and maybe get some sort of release?
'Highwayman' by The Highwaymen is my personal favourite
Overcome by live
Angels Among Demons - Intrumental Core.

Every time I want to test out a headset or just want that music chills feeling, this is the first one I play. It's so simple but to me it just hits different.
Chris Stapleton- Tennessee Whiskey
 Since ive been loving you by led zeppelin always makes me cry
Riders on the storm by The Doors
*I Am the Mercury* - Jimmie Spheeris
Cradle of Filth. It got me through some pretty bleak times. Try Coffin Fodder. It sounds horrible, but it's actually quite beautiful.
Current by Phoria
Dominik Eulberg - The Space Between Us
So many beautiful songs I see mentioned already but I want to give a shout out to River of Deceit by Mad Season. It might be the world's most calming song, and that's kind of crazy with Layne Staley and Mike McCready behind it.
Light My Love - Greta Van Fleet. Honestly, all their songs and lyrics are incredibly beautiful! But especially their newest album, The Battle at Garden's Gate
I just wanna f*ck you - Dr. Dre ft Snoop Dog
Say all I need - one republic
Maria Callas - Un bel di vedremo  ( Puccini ) .  Beautiful voice.

Heartlines by EMBRZ takes it for me
For film music and/or a little bombastic I would recommend The Riders Of Rohan by Howard Shore. 

Say My Name by Within Temptation is also a beautiful song in my opinion. It's from a gothic rockband from the Netherlands. It's one of their milder songs.
Humming one of your songs - Ane Brun
Saturn by Sleeping at Last
Stay Alive by Jose Gonzalez
Hurt - Johnny Cash
Ludovico Einaudi - Melodia Africana III

A small instrumental piece that highlights the precious moments in life with a glimmer of hope.

Weird trippy ass song. I love it.
Manchester Orchestra- The Silence.
Somewhere over the rainbow - Israel Kamakawiwo’ole
Tezeta by Mulatu Astake
We Are The People by Empire of the Sun. Not sure what it is about this song but it makes me happy and sad at the same time. I almost always have a smile tear whilst listening to this one.
Tail Lights by Drew OfThe Drew. Listened to it on the evening of my first psychedelic experience. The richness of the voice covers you like a blanket. 

Side note: I’d Love To Change The World- Jetta, Matstubs is an absolute banger that I also discovered that fateful night.
song of the birds chirping in the morning

or finally getting that spotify adblocker to work
Swans - the sound

Moby’s Porcelain and Chopin’s Berceuse in D-Flat Major, Op. 57
Drifting by Jimi Hendrix or Anyone Can Move a Mountain by Marlena Shaw
scatmans world

Fairytale of New York. It doesn’t have to be December to get lost in that song.

A list of the most beautiful songs I can think of.

And yes I might have *just a little bit* of a Dio obsession.
The great escape
The most beautiful song I have ever heard has to be Sampha-Happens. For the last few years, I been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend. Then one day she asks me to listen to music with her and sends me that song. This song somehow just perfectly represents both our struggles, our fears but also our love for one another. If you are in a tough relationship, I suggest you give it a listen. Might help.

Not well known at all: celebration of life by Ed van fleet. My favorite song that always brings me peace. 
And
Saddest day ever by divide the day. Because all good things must come to an end.
Summer Breeze by the Iseleys
Not sure if it's the most beautiful I've ever heard, but Keturahwaltz by Daniel Knox came immediately to mind when I read the question. Not very long at all, no vocals, but a really beautiful piano and string arrangement.
To build a home - cinematic orchestra
Lol, from what I can see, not enough metal in this list. 2 of my go to tracks are: Mine is the Grandeur of Melancholy Burning by Dark Tranquillity, and; Gloom Beauty and Despair by Swallow the Sun. Always helps get me out of a funk.

Shrike by Hozier
Claire de lune on guitar
A Way Of Life - Hans Zimmer
Cat's in the cradle, the Harry Chapin version. Such a beautiful song.
For me, Supermarket Flowers by Ed Sheehan is up there. My mom isn't even dead yet (and hopefully she won't be for a long time), but I just know that this song is describing exactly how it's going to feel.
Can't pick between Hide and Seek by Imogen Heap, or Arisen My Senses by Björk. Pagan Poetry's beautiful as well.

It's a musical applause given to those that do the impossible.
Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley
Billie Jean - Michael Jackson
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young - Our House
Octavarium - Dream Theater.

[Love Poem](https://youtu.be/OcVmaIlHZ1o) by IU was written by her as a way of examining the grief she felt after losing three of her close friends in one year, and is about passing on the love that they gave to the world now that they're gone. It's a beautiful song.

I know it is a "piece" and not a "song", but it is a truly captivating piano piece.
Into the mystic - Van Morrison
Already posted here but I'd like to add I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight, by the Cutting Crew. IDK what it is, it has this "je ne sais quoi" that makes me feel really weird, a mix of nostalgia, despair, love.
Sleepwalk by Santo and Johnny
Flesh and bone by Keaton Henson.

First heard it 5 years ago while dealing with cancer, divorce, and suicides.

This rendition of Merry-go-round of life

https://youtu.be/_NgegRlk6_8
Rylynn by Andy McKee
Time + Great Gig in the Sky - Pink Floyd

Every time I listen to this song, I am reminded that my time here is finite and that death will come for all of us eventually. I am reminded of how my days are passing me by and how I'm only growing older.

These songs aren't beautiful because they're out to make you feel happy or sad, or because they're trying to describe something to you. These songs are beautiful because they serve as a momento mori, and I think with how fast everything moves today we should all take some time to listen to this song.

99% of life is bullshit and only the critical 1% will define and give context to everything we do: don't squander your 1%.
La campanella by paganini, absolutely beautiful whether it be on violin, piano or guitar. Just a beautiful piece when the phrasing is right
Seven Spanish Angels sung by Ray Charles and Willie Nelson
I know imma get so much hate for this but the most recent one i gotta say the new Kanye and The game song Eazy. 
Like the song starts with gangsta rap with the game talking about growing in the hood like most rap songs if i do say so. Butttttt. The lyrics and the cadence its just sooo nice and rolls so easy (no pun intended) 
And then kanyes verse. People clowning him so much for the pete davidson diss but what they dont see is all the pain in the lyrics before tht. 
He says something about wearing shoes in the shower. Like bro is mad fucked up. And ppl just laugh. 
Its beautifully painful and theres just something about the chorus tht brings is it back around. 
I dont know. Maybe its just me. But i think it’s beautiful and super hard at the same time. 

Dislike me pls. So tht i know i think uniquely
Alpha - C418
The first few seconds of Paper Walls by Yellowcard
je te laisserai des mots - patrick watson
Bizarrely, ‘That’s My Girl’ by The Osmonds
I feel like it is terribly cliche, but i really like hallelujah. Jeff Buckley specifically. I don’t have any idea the meaning behind it, but it carries such strong emotion in the flow and tone. Probably why it has become a cliche, and a lot of Christians are sure that it is faith affirming for some reason.
Spring 1 - Max Richter

Hands down, there’s no more beautiful of a song to exist
An die Musik by Schubert is perfect.
Andrea Bocelli's "Fall on me"
Hayley Westenra "Listen to the Wind"
Kishi Bashi - Violin Tsunami

It is inspired by the Japanese internment camps in the wake of Pearl Harbor. The quote at the end “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” still gives me chills. 

I recommend watching the official animated music video that goes along with it on the Joyful Noise Recordings channel because the animation is really incredible. When the fields start rolling like the surface of the ocean, it hit swells along with the music so perfectly. And then those dark buildings light up like paper lanterns and slowly drift away into the starry night sky.

Verse 1

When our faith was on the edge of the wind
The summer days on end
Memories of the settling sunlight 
Would tell a different way to be
To be, to be

And my favorite Verse 3

When in song we are blessed to be
Mending the rift of our apathy
I have the answer
You will remain 
Days on end after the end of the cancer
One day you will follow at the sound of laughter
One day we’ll fall in love.

Currently? The Rumbling by SiM

Tbh though I really can't answer this question. Music always hits different depending on the mood/context/etc. There is no *one singular* "most beautiful song I've ever heard" it's impossible.
Man of the hour by Pearl Jam and Nothing else matters by Metallica.
What Sarah Said by Death Cab For Cutie. 

It's tragically beautiful. I lost my mom and my brother within 10 months of each other and it makes me think of them in such a vivid way.
Either, “Woah: a mind in awe,” or “changes.” Both by xxxtentacion.
Old man by Neil young always makes me think of my father as I get older I realize he was just trying to get through this massive clusterfuck that is life and it really gives me a different perspective on how he handled everything that came at us 
Which also reminds me of Cats in the cradle by harry chapin
Work it by ylvis
Can’t believe I haven’t seen M83 mentioned here yet. Anyways they are my all time fav for over a decade now. Every single album is incredible. I can’t just list one sadly so I’ll list some of my absolute favs that fit this thread. If you’re giving any of these a listen then pls just lay back and close your eyes and zone out / into the music.

https://youtu.be/7D4vNcK6D38

If anyone is interested.. this is coke studio pakistan and they have produced a lot of fantastic songs. This is their first song from season 14 and it is just so beautiful.
DAMN that's hard to decide, for me it's either

Kino-Peremen (makes me remember the first time I played Metro Exodus, that game had an incredible story

or

Yi Jian Mei (not because of the meme but because I think it's just a very beautiful song)
I dont know if its the best one ive ever heard, but jacob collier's moon river is absolutely amazing. The climax of the song uses microtonality to be out of tune yet in tune. It was a whole new experience ive never heard before and it just worked perfectly. As the song wraps up he smoothly and slowly brings the tuning back to normal and its just great.
Isabella's lullaby.
Mojo pin -Jeff Buckley 

Song gives me goosebumps every time
Sami yusaf - healing
Enigma- End Of Innocence.

Changes, Black Sabbath, Charles Bradley version

Daydreaming by radiohead
How to Disappear Completely - Radiohead
Echoes - Pink Floyd

fine line by harry styles
“All Things Must Pass” by George Harrison. Still remember the day my ex wife passed away, heard this song and just broke down. We weren’t together when she died, but we were married for almost 12 years and she’s the mother of my boys, so I’ll always have love for her. That song hits so hard now.

Hands- Jewel. The most beautiful song I have ever heard
Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up
“Achilles Come Down” by Gang of Youths
Pretty much the entire Arcane soundtrack. Ok and also the soundtrack for James Cameron's Avatar. James Horner made pandora REAL.
Enya's song on the LOTR soundtrack.
Shine on you crazy diamond by Pink Floyd
And completely different genre, but power by childish gambino, the monologue at the end is so amazingly beautiful
Achilles come down by Gang of youths

I scrolled 5 minutes in this thread and couldn't find it, but it's just.. very emotional
“Myth” by Beach House.  “Wishes” is also great; the music video is RIDICULOUS.
U-Turn (Lili) by AaRON
it's an undertale song called spider dance, do not be deceived by the name
Nightswimming by REM has to be up there.
No Time for Caution. Cover by Grissini Project - https://youtu.be/zg5QMysuSYg

"Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye" - Leonard Cohen
Serenity by Kupla
"Je t'aimais, je t'aime, et je t'aimerai" by Francis Cabrel.

(My translation of this title: "I loved you, I love you still, I always will.")

The words themselves, the images, and the music combine to make this the most beautiful love song I've ever heard.

I'm also fond of "For Emily, whenever I may find her" by Simon and Garfunkel. Overflowing emotion, not because of anything she did, but just because she is. Powerful.
Definitely many. One of them that comes to mind right now is Kemal by Manos Hadjidakis.
Brokedown Palace by Grateful Dead. Music for the soul right there
If i were by vashti bunyan
I have still got the blues for you.
Child's play IAMDDB
The theme song from the movie Arrival has been one of my favourites since it came out, it always makes me cry, it’s called “on the nature of daylight”. I highly recommend watching Arrival or at least the scene where this song plays in the movie.

This song gives me chills. It feels like they tapped into something outside of themselves with the vocals on this one, and it’s almost creepy in a way. Love it.

** editing to add 

J.S. Bach - Orchestral Suite No. 3: Air

This song is without a doubt the most beautiful thing I have ever heard. Once I honestly listened and opened myself up to this one, I could ‘feel’ the music inside my heart. I know that sounds silly, but I really don’t have words to describe the emotion I feel when I listen to this.
Sabrina, by Einstürzende Neubauten
Hey baby hey by Greg brown really hits you in the feels
A lot of songs on here are great songs, but more sad than beautiful. I think beautiful have a real sense of romance, almost uplifting albeit in a sad way.

I think it’s gotta be Monster Love by Goldfrapp.

Also Find the River by REM. 
And maybe Reindeer King by Tori Amos.

I still don't know what the lyrics mean, I didn't google the translation, but I feel like I don't need to understand them. The atmosphere of the song is enough for me.

Song of the siren. This Mortal coil.

Or

https://youtu.be/W9FlDMCo8LU
Dimash- Sinful Passion. 
His voice..the song… I had such euphoria listening to it the first time I had a mental orgasm.
This must be the place/ the talking heads. It’s by far my favorite love song
"The first time ever I saw your face" - Roberta Flack
Fields of Gold by Sting
Mozart - Requiem In D Minor, K 626  


It's actually ridiculous how moving it is. There are definitely pieces that compare, but this is the one I always go back to in the end. It just evokes so many emotions.
Motion picture soundtrack and fake plastic trees! Both by Radiohead
Nightwish - Ever Dream
The Hymn of Acxiom by Vienna Teng
Strafford apartments - bon Iver. The entire 33 God album is incredibly ethereal and makes you contemplate everything from the meaning of life to your past mistakes.
Not the most, one of the best (it just depends on current mood)...

She by Grand Avenue
Agaetis Byrjun - Sigur Ros
Yesterday

Specifically the live version from their Anesthetize album.  PT is a great band that not enough people have heard of—think Pink Floyd if they came out in the 90s
Volcano by Damien Rice. It stopped me in my tracks when I first heard it. Also Maps by The yeah yeah yeahs
Summercat, by Billie the Vision and the Dancers.
The song has a sad "last time we'll see each other" vibe I can't just ignore. Brings me to tears whenever I listen to it
Hard to decide, really. 

There’s My Future by Billie Eilish, the meaning being that you don’t have to be in a relationship to be happy, that you can love yourself the way you are. 

Truce, by twenty one pilots. Basically, struggling with yourself is tiring. So for now, we’ll make a truce with our inner demons tonight, and resume the battle again tomorrow. That song made me cry the first time I heard it lol

Anaal Nathrakh - Tod Huetet Uebel
ain’t no way by aretha franklin
Seal - kiss from a rose...idk, but something which instantly changes my mood if i listen to it
Beautiful - Smashing Pumpkins
Have to go with Romeo and Juliet, Dire Straits.
Piano man by Billy Joel, every time I hear it it’s like it makes this movie in my brain and makes me care about all the characters in the song, it also gives me a lot of nostalgia to when I would hear it play in my dads workshop

The Wisp Sings by Winter Aid
Zajdi zajdi
Weathered - Jack Garratt
Lake Shore Drive by Aliotta Haynes

Postcards from Italy by Beirut
lovely-billie elish

say what you want, but this song hits too close to home.
Us by Regina Spektor

https://youtu.be/fczPlmz-Vug
**Girlfriend in a coma** - pretty much everything by the The Smith’s.
We Can Just Make Out by The Six Parts Seven. Just instrumental, but it lets the instruments breathe so much more into the music.
A Day in the Life of a Tree by The Beach Boys
Glass Beach  - Bedroom Community
Still lovin' you-Scorpions!
Moby - When It's Cold I'd Like To Die
Eva Cassidy’s version of [Fields of Gold](https://youtu.be/9UVjjcOUJLE)

It’s even more amazing that she wasn’t even famous until after she died. Nobody really knew about her.

Plus the comments on that video are killing me..
Mummers Dance. I forgot the artist. The song is hauntingly beautiful.

Second choice is Nights in White Satin by the Moody Blues. Simon & Garfunkle’s Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme. And the song the dwarves sing in The Hobbit. Unchained Melody. Garth Brooks The Dance or The River.
Moonlight Sonata
Bye Mom - El Ten Eleven
Anything out of AnjunaBeats record label
Art Garfunkel - Bridge Over Troubled Water, especially the live version filmed in NY central park concert
3 Libras by A Perfect Circle.
I’ve always felt Bron-Yr-Aur by Zeppelin had an angelic quality to it. Not to be confused with Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp, which is still great though
"You've got a friend" -either version really but I prefer the James Taylor one. 

Just a beautifully sweet song.
Can't say, all the songs I love are all beautiful in their own way, even my personal favorites, but the one I listen to a lot is "My Heart is Buried in Venice" by Ricky Montgomery.
Dear God- By Avenged Sevenfold
Maria, from West Side Story. The first line answers the question posed by the post.
La Lune by Billie Marten
Something inside so strong by labi siffre
Angel of death by Slayer
The Whistler - The White Buffalo 
Or
Come Join the Murder - The White Buffalo (from Sons of Anarchy)

He has many good songs, and he definitely has a specific tone and vibe. But this particular song just stands out.
GUMMO
Teardrop by Massive Attack
Gloomy Sunday by Billie holiday
Wiggles covering tame impala
Shelter - Porter Robinson
Boats N Hoes
I came to say this. So emotional, nostalgic and beautiful. It hits you deep.

Ahee - I feel it
The shrine/ an argument - the fleet foxes
Mr. Blue Sky
I always find myself going back to Basia Bulat - Little Waltz.
Cloud busting by Kate bush!!
Must be never enough by Loren Alred. 

Every time I hear it I think about my son and the power the lyrics and just the flow of it make me tear up damn near every time
Taylor Swift - Epiphany. It’s a song about the horrors of war and the helplessness soldiers feel in the beginning, then it switches to a medical provider watching people die of covid and unable to help. The way she melds the two through the music itself is just beautiful and it will make me cry every damn time.
"Everything's alright" and "Wish my life away", both by Laura Shigihara. From the games To the Moon, and Finding Paradise, respectively. Yes, it's the same artist that made the Plants vs Zombies soundtrack. But give them both a good listen. It's better if you know the game's stories and lore.
Road song - tigran hamasyan
A lot of my first thoughts have already been covered - Landslide and Songbird by Fleetwood Mac, Hunger Strike by Temple of the Dog, 3 Libras by A Perfect Circle, Holst's Jupiter, Jeff Buckley's cover of Hallelujah to mention a few.

Haven't seen Last Goodbye by Jeff Buckley mentioned yet, and Safe & Sound by The Civil Wars & Taylor Swift absolutely captured me when I first heard it. A bit more obscure, but I feel that Endless Summer, The Comeback Kid, and Memories from The Rearview Mirror EP by The Midnight deserve an honourable mention.
Cliffs of Dover by Eric Johnson

I hate finding these good AskReddit threads when I'm about to hit the bed. I want to listen to the songs but I've gotta be up in a few hours for work.
Lmao the only song I know from this entire comment section is Claire de Lune by Debussy. That is certainly a very beautiful song.

Tbh I think reddit has a problem with being snobby with music. There seems to be a strong bias towards certain artists, eras and genres of music. It's pretty noticeable when you look through this comment section.

Lover, You Should’ve Come Over by Jeff Buckley
When I was really young, I had a music box that played the Greensleeves folk song.

It was my first escape, my imagination filled in the orchestra. I escaped abuse as a child in a lot of different places.

The first time I heard Fantasia on Greensleeves by Vaughn Williams, it was like finding out magic was real.

Now I’m older, and the song makes me cry ‘cause all my dreams are dead.. but still an objectively beautiful song!
"The Sunlit Earth" from the Shadow of the Colossus soundtrack. The entire soundtrack is probably one of the best video game music ever made but that song is the most emotional pieces I can think of, makes my hair stand every time.

My dad loves telling the story how he asked the lead singer (Hope Sandoval) if she wanted to get a drink with him.  After he seen her and the band in a pub in Dublin not too long after they performed at a gig...

My dad said Hope just looked at him weirdly for a few seconds, then looked away . So technically he didn't get rejected !
He was a good stalker.
The live version of Gravity by Sara Bareilles. It’s been well over 10 years since I first heard it and I still cry.
The Odyssey -Symphony X
It’s relatively new but Gabby Barrett’s “Footprints on the Moon” is amazingly empowering imo
Ulrich Schnauss - Goodbye
Street of Dreams and This Nearly Was Mine- both by Lindsay Buckingham

There are a lot that could take the award for most beautiful song, but Mr. Blue Sky takes the spot easily. Not only it is a great song but I used to listen to it during 2020 so much that listening to it takes me back to when we thought it was just a 2 week vacation.

There are a lot of songs I consider the most beautiful, but as for now it’s “Rings of Saturn” by Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds
Ivy by Taylor Swift. Also Mirrorball. When she sings the word “hush” in Mirrorball i get goosebumps every single time. Folklore and Evermore have some beautiful songs on them.

Sowing the seeds of love by tears for fears is up there for me. Has emotional context though because it was one of the favorite songs of a friend that took his life two years ago.
Fanfare for the common man
This song is in korean, but the english translation made me cry, it’s D.O. - It’s Okay

Senses that have become dull 
Due to the many feelings that have passed by 
Ways of hiding my true heart 
That I’ve become used to since some time 

Where have I come to? 
I’ve only ran looking forward 
I’m scared of looking back for some reason 
Stories I’ve pushed back 

As time goes by, 
I send away the happy times 
and the tearful days that made my chest hurt 
naturally like the sun and that moon that rise and fall every day, altogether

 Sometimes we cry, sometimes we laugh 
We expect things and get hurt 
We flutter in excitement again and become dulled
 Just do what your heart pleases 

Just like how countless stars did, 
always [in] the same spot 
you will shine brightly on your own 
Dont hide yourself 
Will you show me yourself, comfortably? 
Just as yourself
That’s right, it’s okay to be okay...
stella by kashiwa daisuke. It is 36 minutes long yet i keep coming back to it.

First one that comes to my mind.
Not enough people are providing links in this thread. I don't believe anyone who couldn't take a moment to directly share their song.

Ella Fitzgerald’s version of Over the Rainbow. Without lyrics, I’d have to give it to the Love Theme from Rhapsody in Blue. They’re both incredibly “simple”, but they’re beautiful and important to me so that’s all that matters.

“Mother of Pearl” by Roxy Music
Andrea Bocceli, Sarah Brightman - Time to Say Goodbye, very much a bittersweet song for me, never heard it untill I was in Ireland, was meeting a girl who i'd gotten very close to over Yahoo chat/phone calls, we knew we had feelings for each other but this was our first time meeting and it confirmed that those feelings were real, was only there for a few days so leaving was a bit heart breaking and then while waiting for my flight, this song came on over the speakers, I full blown ugly cried

Wires by athlete. 
Having a premature daughter at Christmas time its like the song was written for us as the song is set at Christmas. The song played on one of my journeys to the hospital at the time and it broke me. Even now i tear up when i hear it. My girlfriend cant listen to it. But for me it reminds if a hard time that ended well just like the song does.
As i write this my daughter has just woken up and gave me a cuddle. She is 5 now and is our world. Definitely going to listen to athlete today.

*Somebody to Love - Queen*
The theme song of Rohan in The Lord of the Rings

The whole composition is beautiful, but there is one specific part of it that brings a tear to my eye every time i listen to it. It is played when Theoden picks up his sword after being freed from Sarumans influence, and also in the final battle of the Pelennor Fields when the Rohirrim charges into the war.

This part has so much buildup, especially when watching the film, that when it finally plays it feels like a victorious relief of pure glory.

The specific track I listen to to hear it is "The Battle of the Pelennor Fields" from Return of the King.

Runaway by Kanye West
GG Allin - Eat My Diarrhoea
Indian Sunset, by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, has to be up there. I know, I know, there are lots of historical inaccuracies throughout, but… 
“Now there seems no reason why, I should carry on,
In this land, that once was my land, I can’t find a home,
It’s lonely, and it’s quiet, and the horse soldiers are coming,
So I think it’s time I strung my bow, and cease my senseless running,
For soon I’ll find my yellow moon, along with my loved ones,
Where the buffalo graze in the clover fields, without the sound of guns,
And the red sun sinks at least, into the hills of gold,
And peace, to this young warrior, comes with a bullet hole”
Ode to the Mets by The Strokes

Deez Nuts (Trap Remix)
Octavarium by Dream Theater.  
Particularly the part where the acoustic guitar starts and the "The Razor's Edge" part. This song is 24 minutes long (!). The acoustic guitar part is also the saddest thing I've ever heard in my life. 
  
It's a shame that a lot of people will die without even knowing this song exists.

Idk i’ve always really enjoyed hallelujah, specifically by Jeff Buckley. Theres a few versions though and honestly i only ever could get into one, I dont even know what the versions called but it’s been a favourite since i was young. The rest are just as beautiful but i will forever sing to it and the other versions mess up my timing lmao. His voice is just so spectacular and every bit of that song proves it.
Goo Goo Dolls - Iris
Apotheosis by Austin Wintory from the soundtrack to the game Journey. Something about it just sounds so heartbreakingly hopeful and the ending sounds so sad. Like all that hope was just for naught. The entire soundtrack is just magical to me.

The way the notes come together into something beautiful is just magic.

Fix You by Coldplay (or the Acapella version by Naturally Seven). Both make me cry every time.
Tron Legacy Main Theme by Daft Punk
Perfect Day - Lou Reed
I find the theme song from 'The Piano' very beautiful and special. My dad plays piano by ear rather than reading notes and that song has been one that he has always played. It is very special to me. (And I haven't even seen the movie!)
My Mom sang to me once. I cried from how beautiful it was. She's not a great outstanding singer, but it was more beautiful than any singer could ever be

Man, every time a thread like this appears you always get people posting the most mundane, mainstream shit. Doubt anyone will see my contribution but for me it's Ashes are Burning by Renaissance. What a voice.
[DreamWeaver - Gary Wright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZKuzwPOefs)

No wait! [Dust in the Wind - Kansas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH2w6Oxx0kQ)

But, what about? Shit! How do you pick one song that's the best? I've never been able to pick a favorite.
“Pieces of a Man” - Gil Scott Heron.
“Just Breathe” - Pearl Jam.
Ghost Atlas - Demons

Jesse Cash has just to the most amazing voice i've ever heard.
Crosby Stills and Nash: Helplessly Hoping

Dire Straights: Brothers in Arms

Pink Floyd: Wish You Where Here

Johny Cash: Hurt

Brad Paisley & Allison Craus: Whiskey Lullaby 

The Eagles: Seven Bridges Road


I'm also going to mention something, Home Free's covers of Brothers in Arms and Helplessly Hoping are absolutely beautiful.
Caoineadh Cú Chulainn (Lament), song by Bill Whelan in Riverdance. Played by Davy Spillane. Keep your tissues close by
Sade - By your side
Hurt - Johnny cash. It’s dark but in its own way beautiful and very powerful
[Toast](https://youtu.be/eF_W7c2RD-c) by Pond. I can't say it's the most beautiful song I've ever heard, but it's a new song you should check out.
Turning Page by Sleeping At Last
Blackbird - Martyn Bennett
[Sparkle by RADWIMPS. ](https://youtu.be/83DCAtLl2Yg) Don’t watch this if you haven’t seen Kimi no Na wa./your name. and have any intention to; in which case look this up on Spotify or whatever and play it there. 

It’s so incredible because the song was made for this scene shown in the video. And then they played the song live, with a whole symphony, while the movie played. Of course they did it in Japan, so it’s the Japanese dub with no English subtitles. Still a major spoiler as it’s the climax of the film, and the trailer does a great job of showing what the movie *isn’t* all about… 

On one hand, the song is way better without all the talking. The best part is the instrumental part in the middle - there is, in fact, an English version, but they cut out the whole instrumental section. Still a six minute epic, but nowhere near as good as the full length version of the song - and having seen the movie as many times as I have in both languages, I know what they’re saying and singing anyway. I don’t know Japanese, certainly can’t speak it, but I understand everything being said or sang in this video (and the movie in its entirety watching it like they’re showing it here - I’ve done that a few times).

If you’re wondering about what happens at the end of the video, the delay is actually intentional - light travels faster than sound, so from where you’re watching from, you would see that before hearing it. Though I’m not sure the delay would be quite that much.
The song that came to mind was "All I Want" by Kodaline. It's probably not the most beautiful song however.
moon - ye
I made a Youtube and Youtube.music playlist - containing the top 101 songs from this thread (7.5 hours of music):

Youtube playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h1davKgBYM&list=PLU52JNnC-3QHstnL-KplB9sVXPsTlzpbf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h1davKgBYM&list=PLU52JNnC-3QHstnL-KplB9sVXPsTlzpbf)

The stable song - Gregory Alan Isakov
Ludovico Einaudi, the man’s made of music, so any composition by him works for this.

Interstellar - Hans Zimmer

As The World Caves In - Matt Maltese
Waterloo Sunset - The Kinks. Ray Davies makes a dirty train station sound gorgerous. He really knew how to express the beauty of the everyday.
Hope leaves by Opeth
The Mosquito Song - Queens of the Stone Age
This Bitter Earth/On the Nature of Daylight

Dinah Washington and Max Richter

I used to sit in my car with my eyes closed and turn it up so loud. There's a really good bass hit after the first part that can hit you in the chest subtle and violent at the same time.
"Breathe" or "state of love and trust" by Pearl Jam
“Golden brown” the stranglers, “visions of Johanna “ bob dylan.
Jig O' beer and chai
Not a song but an instrumental tune,but it's really soothing for me,u should definitely hear it
Tom Day - Who We Want to Be
only 1 by metro boomin and travis scott
Probably really against the grain here, but:

Architects - Death is absolutely safe

Song speaks on so many emotional levels. 

Although ask me tomorrow I may have a different answer

Nutshell - Alice in chains
Sometimes It Snows In April - Prince
Butterflies - Michael Jackson
"BB's Theme" - Death Stranding
A different kind of beautiful from others in this thread, but And Plague Flowers the Kaleidoscope by Ne Obliviscaris does it for me. The first two minutes are kinda violin driven Flamenco, then the guitars come in and it turns to a progressive extreme metal tour de force with incredible guitar and violin solos, beautiful clean and harsh vocals with beautiful structure and flow. Every time I hear it I get goosebumps the same as the first time.
Andante Cantabile - Tchaikovsky  Hands down the most beautiful song

Personally, I think songs are not a patch on just music alone (something like Claire de Lune is sublime) but I think I would go for ‘Have You Ever Seen the Rain’ by CCR.
I don't know if this qualifies as most beautiful,  but as an Empath this song,especially  along with the video ( in this case actually a commercial) described how my mind works and the feeling of the worlds problems on your mind constantly

Luv(sic.) pt3 by Nujabes.

It’s so melancholy in its tunes but so beautiful and hopeful in its lyrics.

pt2 is just as fantastic. I only discovered them recently though so I’d probably find some more ‘beautifully nostalgic songs’ if I dug a little deeper in my noggin.

“A Moment in the Life of Me” by Dax Johnson

I can’t explain it, but I want to be someone that, when people hear that song, they’re reminded of me. It’s so beautiful, original, complex, and something about it touches my soul. I strive every day to become the personification of that song.

CLANNAD-Theme from Harry's Game

The Silence by The Manchester Orchestra.

It makes me forget to breathe.
Gravity by EDEN. But my favorite thing is the whole end credits album and how each song flows into the next has me feeling some type of way
"Something good" by Alt-J

And for an oddball, Abdelazer Suite 2: Rondeau
["Forever More" by Last Heroes](https://youtu.be/1YfaNJsapJ8) musically it's beautiful, the lyrics and their meanings are equally so as well! Such a heart-warming song that never ceases to make me feel good!
Not so much the entire song, but when Johnny Cash sang Hurt the line “And you can have it all my empire of dirt” stuck with me.
Barely anyone will see this in 15.1k comments but the single-most beautiful song in my own opinion is a certain song titled: Clockwork by the artist: Powerglove.
Moonlight Sonata. When I first heard it I was having difficulty sleeping/insomnia. Decided to put headphones in and clicked Moonlight Sonata on repeat! I thought it was so beautiful I tears up and got a good nights rest.
I'm a fan of The Moon Song.

"Wenn du mich lässt" by German singer LEA. It's about her partner not being able to love himself and being sunk into depression.

To Build a Home - The Cinematic Orchestra
Real Folk Blues - The Seatbelts

I don't know what Yoko Kanno captured in that song. Its warm like a record and has this hypnotic melody that ebbs and flows through the guitars and saxs that plants me in the middle of a smoky speakeasy. The beautiful delivery by the singer is just the icing. Just the beginning lines captures me.

Its one of those songs that just hits me. I always tear up. I don't understand a majority of the lyrics but I sure as shit *feel* what the song is talking about. Thats why I like music in different languages. I prefer to experience it. And not knowing the what the song is talking about really.. how do I say this.. your focus isn't on the message, but the gestalt of the piece. 

But that could be the music ear I just have. A band geek I was. I like to pick apart the piece. Listen to what the arrangement is and what they are doing throughout it. How many instruments there are, what are they. One I love to come back because of just how fun it is to really listen to.

I don't believe in an interventionist God  
But I know, darling, that you do  
But if I did I would kneel down and ask Him

Not to touch a hair on your head  
To leave you as you are  
And if He felt He had to direct you  
Then direct you into my arms

[My grandmother sang me old french songs when I was a child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyAYu3nsZLI)
Strobe - Deadmau5
Nine - Sleeping At Last. The whole album is based on the 9 different personalities of the Enneagram test. It genuinely choked me up the first time listening
Claire de Lune - Flight Facilities, Christine Hoberg. I think it’s the perfect example of a beautiful song. Peaceful yet emotional.
Little sunshine by yuichiro oda
Digital Love by Daft Punk

. Actually makes me overwhelmed with happy tears a lot of the time. Not sure why, I just feel emotional when I listen to it.
Plainsong - The Cure

This song creates the most incredible atmosphere, and mixed with the somewhat somber lyrics I think it makes for a truly beautiful song.
Canon in D, Brooklyn Duo version.
The River by Bruce Springsteen
i would say aurora's "exist for love". my definition of a beautiful song.
Anything off Nurture by Porter Robinson but if we gotta make choices then either Wind Tempos, Sweet Time, or Trying to Feel Alive

The song is nostalgic depsite never earing it. It's magic.
Fireflies
To Hell And Back by Sabaton is my favorite song, you might like it too if you enjoy metal.
“Song to the Siren” by This Mortal Coil. 

Liz Frasier of Cocteau Twins also sang Teardrop for Massive Attack, but this, a cover of a Tim Buckley song, is her most hauntingly beautiful recording.

My number two would be “Under The Ivy” by Kate Bush. Originally a b-side for the “Running Up That Hill” single, it was added to later versions of the “Hounds of Love” album.
Saturn by Sleeping at Last
Alrighty, I can't pick just one most beautiful song so I'm gonna have to give you a list if that's okay.
There are so many songs that can be considered beautiful a ton of which are not in this list but this list is a bunch that I consider to be beautiful in their own ways.

Not a song, but rather a musical piece from Riverdance.

I taught myself how to play the piano to play that song - well, if the ability to play 2 songs on the piano counts as having learned to play.

James Taylor has written so many beautiful songs, but the one that sticks out for me is Only A Dream In Rio from the album That's Why I'm Here. The subtle guitar picking, the syncopated rhythm, the ascending chord sequence and key changes, the whole thing just culminates in a beautiful, mellow and uplifting sound.
Encore - Red Hot Chilli Peppers

Fall With Your Knife, by Peter Murphy

For me its "Messed Up On Christmas" probably because I relate to it so hard, "In my Mind" Was also a really good one by her as well. Definitely underrated.
The wind - Cat Stevens
The other side by Ruelle

It was my wedding song and it has made me cry before. I heard it in Arrow and knew that it would be the song for me and my wife.
Roads by Portishead
Farewell Transmission by Songs: Ohia.

OR

The version of “On the Sunny Side of the Street” on Sonny Side Up. The whole thing is perfect, and then Dizzy Gillespie’s vocal at the end is incredible. I remember where I was the first time I heard it.

Song On The Beach; Photograph by Arcade Fire
I would like - Deru

I want - Deru

I know, it's technically two songs, but it's a very similar theme, so it's more like two movements of a symphony. 

They must be listened to in that order to get the full experience.

There's a YouTube video that puts them both together and the transition is seamless. It's 6.5 minutes long and is titled " Deru- I would like"
Virus- sin disfraz
* Oltremare by Ludovico Einaudi is beautiful.
* Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven 
* Paralysed by NF - an unusual choice for a 'beautiful' song but for me, it vocalised how I was feeling and I think there is beauty in that
* Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd

Elephant Woman by Blonde Redhead.
Next of kin - Opeth
Les Fleur by Minnie Riperton.
Falling slowly by Glen Hasgard and Marketa Irgová
Let Down by Radiohead
Evermore. The whole album. Every listen up. I know Taylor Swift is not as popular. But her new albums are great. Take time to listen please. My favourite in evermore is Champagne Problems.
Maybe Pagodes?
bon iver - lump sum
"Teo Torriatte" by Queen.  I don't know if it is the most beautiful song, but it holds a special place in my heart.  I sang it as a lullaby for my sister's kids when I babysat them.
My favourites not in order:

Set the fire to the third bar - Snow Patrol

All I Want - Kodaline

What a wonderful world - Louis Armstrong

Anything that evokes emotion I instantly love but these are three incredibly beautiful songs
i forget the name of it
the ecstasy of gold by Ennio Morricone.
The Beauty of Uncertainty - KT Tunstall
"Nothing's impossible" by Depeche Mode!
Commercial break #7 by The Phantom's Revenge
I've spent many decades around songs, singers, sound, it's very much, one of my happy places.

Jimmy McCarthy - "No Frontiers". 

From the album, The song of the singing horseman.
Hallelujah - Jeff Buckley. I know there are a lot of really good versions out there of this truly moving piece of music, but this one always brings me to tears no matter what is going on. It so perfectly captures the essence of those emotions we all struggle to show and express.
Father and son - Cat Stevens
Philadelphia by Neil Young is quite touching.
Waltz no. 2, close second Your Hand in Mine
Wait - JP Cooper
That is an excellent question.
Principles of Lust by Enigma
Maria Schneider - The Thompson fields
Leave it all behind (acoustic) by Sleeping With Sirens
Re: stacks by Bon Iver
Fleetwood macs songbird as sung by Eva Cassidy.  Incredible.

«Almost was good enough» by Magnolia Electric Co.
Anchor by Novo Amor
Haven’t seen it on here yet but, “Cat Stevens - Father and Son” is amazing to me.
Let the cards fall by the Breath. Something about the chorus makes me tear up every time I hear it, so beautiful and heartfelt.
Here There and Everywhere - The Beatles.
in terms of lyrics and harmony, God Only Knows by The Beach Boys

in terms of instrumentation, either Ave Maria by Franz Liszt, Un Sospiro by Franz Liszt, or Time by Pink Floyd

but in terms of message, Darlin’ by the Beach Boys, because it’s my girlfriend and I’s song. specifically the royal philharmonic version with the violins and trumpets.
Nude - Radiohead
Comfortably Numb has the most beautiful guitar work I’ve ever heard. It brings up a deep, visceral response every time I hear the second solo in particular. 

I know the song is part of a concept album, and there’s a specific story behind it, but the lyrics also hit really hard about what it’s like to have depression, and how often people either don’t understand or care what you’re dealing with. They just want you to suck it up, push it down, and act like a normal happy person.
[On the Nature of Daylite](https://youtu.be/rVN1B-tUpgs)  Max Richter
Joy to the world
The Garden by Sonata Arctica is definitely up there for me.

Flow from FFXIV Endwalker's soundtrack also definitely worth a mention.
I'm going to go for the classic "Bohemian Rhapsody" and "American Pie"

When I was in a mental institution after a manic episode I heard violin/string instruments in my deams and I woke up and there was a Satyr sitting on my bed, hooves, horns, the lot, and he played me a song and I remember crying.  Since this is the internet I don't mind disclosing it, but don't worry I'm well medicated now and it has been eight years since I last had an episode.  The guy told me he was the devil and he wanted to make a deal  with me and we had a pretty long conversation.  To this day I  mean I know it wasn't real but it felt amazingly lucid and real.  I only ever hear the song in small parts when I'm asleep- I think- because sometimes I can recall bits of it when I wake up in the morning.  It made my heart feel like everything was alright and that's the best way I can explain it tbh.
If I Could and If Ever by Jack Johnson I very much enjoy.

Budapest by George Ezra and Coming Home by Leon Bridges I often find myself singing about my lady.

I know I’m late to this, and this will probably get buried. But for me, the song that always comes up in my mind is Touch has a Memory by Pete Atkin. It’s… just such a beautiful, sorrow filled song that I just can’t help but get emotional every time I listen to it.

"Miserere Mei, deus" gotta be the closest to the sound of heaven.

Not exactly the type of music I'd usually listen to but my favourite song of all, is the most beautiful to me and that's 'Wichita Lineman' by Glen Campbell.
Honeybee by Steam Powered Giraffe. 

This will most likely be an unpopular opinion, and this may not be the most graceful or beautifully sounding song, but the words and feeling of it is beautiful to me. It’s hauntingly beautiful and sad and I adore it.

2Pac has a lot of really beautiful songs. I think Dear Mama is one of the most heartbreaking songs I've ever heard. My Block (Nitty Remix) is also damn sad, but Life Goes On and Changes are also incredibly important songs
I really love Sparkle and Nandemonaiya by RADWIMPS; Sparkle has a particularly lovely cover by Vtuber Ookami Mio on Youtube. 

Nandemonaiya in particular has a really beautiful lyric, which translated, means "Crying even though I'm happy, Laughing even when I'm lonely, its because my heart got here [to you] before I did"

The Cure - A Forest
With progressive rock like most of the tunes I've listed, there's a strong emphasis on the instrumental portions. While Crimson's vocalist John Wetton doesn't have a superb voice, Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins of Genesis more than keep up that end. 


* King Crimson- [Starless](https://youtu.be/OfR6_V91fG8)
* Genesis- [Cinema Show](https://youtu.be/xiW302FICE0)
* Genesis- [Riding the Scree](https://youtu.be/3XL8RXG-QeE)- Yu the main riff at about 1:05
* Genesis- [Ripples](https://youtu.be/gAMBKnKPANo)
* Genesis- [Fading Lights](https://youtu.be/Ao34UhjV5ZM)- the slow opening and closing vocal parts are lovely but nothing extraordinary-- it's the middle instrumental part...amazing 

They're not even in the same universe as Dolores O'Riordan, though. That woman had the voice of an angel, period. 

* Cranberries- [Dreams](https://youtu.be/C2EifAO9ZHg)
Paradise by Coldplay. Made me cry the first time i heard it and it still does to this day
Sky and Sand - Paul Kalkbrenner!
Baba Yetu
Bit geeky.... But Zelda's lullaby, absolutely beautiful music, less of a song, but still
Kishi bashi. Really any kishi bashi song, but bitter sweet genesis for him and her is just beautiful, the twilight cover is also a beautiful song.
Imagine - John Lennon. Classic, I know, but damn. imagine..
Birthday party-the 1975. What a happy melody.
Crispy Socks : Key & Peele
Train song by vashti bunyan
Ok. Hear me out. Fallen by Jaden Smith. I’m 22 so my music taste is obviously going to differ from most who I imagine would be on this thread. But please give this a listen. It’s the first song that made me cry.

Jeff Buckley - Hallelujah.
The thrill is gone - BB King
Calling the Rain - Harakiri for the Sky
The whole album is one of the best mixes of post rock and black metal, and always brings out emotion from me, as it came out during a rough time in my life. I would listen to the album every day walking to class.

"la vie en Rose", Louis Armstrong, "we'll meet again", Vera Lynn, "a kiss to build a dream on", Louis Armstrong, "I love you so", The Walters, "King of the road", Roger Miller. You can maybe sense a theme... :')
Killing ourselves to live by Halestorm and 
Kind im Nebel Live in Köln by Callejon
White Fantasy - SLS

Although short, solo piano, and made for a game, this song makes me mysteriously cry.

Every part that that repeats is slightly modified, and slowly transforms into a new emotion! It makes me feel like I'm being told a short story. How can notes feel so icy cold?

Like I woke up in a snowy cabin in the middle of now where. It's so dead silent and peaceful. I feel alone, but I realize I'd be happy if this was my final destination.
You don't know how lucky you are - Keaton Henson
Napalm Death- You Suffer

Not a huge fan of most Christian music, but Oceans by Hillsong United is a beautifully written and felt piece of music.
[Fly to the Angels](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ukmobha2krY)
Bohemian Rhapsody
Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground- Blind Willie Johnson. Besides being an incredibly beautiful song, the back story adds so much to it. The singer sang this song at a moment in his life when he had lost everything when his house burned down. Years later, Carl Sagan chose this song to be representative for our shared human experience and it was included on the Sounds of Earth record on the Voyager 1. The contrast is so beautiful. Never would this man have thought in that desperate moment that his voice would be among the stars thousands of miles from home for eternity
Cinematic orchestra - To build a home
Fantasy by Earth, Wind and Fire
Song to the siren by rose betts

And then the 9 songs after that on the album *Have You In My Wilderness". It's hard to pick just one. *Vasquez* is a great one if you prefer a more haunting beauty.   
   
Also, *nail I couldn't bite* by SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE. Something special about that one.
   
Lastly, *Flamenco Sketches* by Miles Davis with Cannonball Adderley and John Coltrane. Self explanatory if you listen to it

Midlake - Roscoe
Prepare for obscure songs that no ones ever heard of as everyone tries to be a hipster and be counter-culture instead of naming fairly mainstream songs. I always liked Clocks by Coldplay.
Night city - cyberpunk. 
Just listen to it and you'll know why

Clair de Lune probably.
FreAl luv

It's simply beautifull and full of life, no talk, just one man and his guitar (and some magic) when my son was born this was the song on repeat in the room.
A duet of Aguas de Marzo (Waters of March) by Tom Jobim and Elis Regina.  You’ll laugh; you’ll cry.  It says it all.

Never gonna give you up - Rick Astley
The one I wrote.
Ever heard never gonna let you down by genius musician Rick astley?
Basic ass thread with basic ass answers. How about "Imagine" by John Lennon. Not because I like the song, but just because it fits with the theme.
Trust Issues - by Drake. Not joking lol it just has a really emotionally unique vibe.
Ok maybe more serious: Claire de Lune by Debussy OR the Light of the Seven piano from that Game of Thrones episode Winds of Winter??
I went to NYU during 9/11.  It was obviously a rough day for me, for NY, and for the world. A day later (9/12) I remember being emailed this attachment w U2's "Beautiful Day" playing, and someone had sliced these amazing images at the beginning of the horror of 9/11 but at the end also pics of all the people HELPING each other that day.  

I broke down in tears.  

Not only in horror of what had happened but also the sense of camaraderie and brotherhood NYC displayed in the days afterwards.  It was indeed, beautiful in its own eerie way. 

It was also the first time people started really sending "memes" or other creative material to each other via email. I remember logging into AOL Messenger to try to find out where people were that dreadful day. The internet changed how we all reached out to each other and was certainly a precursor to how we use the internet now.
Claire De Lune
I have six different translations of “aux champs elysees” in my library. “Spit on a Stranger” by Pavement makes my heart skip a beat. “Sogno di Volare” from Civilization VI brings a tear to my eye. The opening riff from “jhak maar ke” from the movie ‘Desi Boyz’ makes me feel like the world is full of potential and good times and beautiful people. My dad used to pump the 90s kpop classic “to mother” by God and “december” by turbo and a song by Coyote that I think translates to “virgin” or something. “Dracula from Houston” by the Butthole Surfers makes me feel like a kid who’ll never grow up.

balls in my ass - kanye west
This is me from the Greatest Showman soundtrack. God it makes me cry every time!
mine is definitely "It's Just A Burning Memory" or "Clair De Lune". two of my absolute favorite songs of all time
Délibes "Duo des Fleurs" sung by Sabine Devieilhe and Marianne Crebassa.

You can hear it for yourself [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1ZL5AxmK_A&list=RDMMC1ZL5AxmK_A&start_radio=1&ab_channel=WarnerClassics)
Did someone post "No Stairway?" cause that's the only right answer.
I don’t really have one. I’m gonna go off of songs that made me cry. All of Me by John Legend I think always makes me cry a little. I can’t describe any song as beautiful and say it’s the most beautiful. But that song makes me cry a lot.
Gymnopedie no. 1 by Erik Satie (the piano version is better than the orchestral version, imo)

Claire de Lune by Debussy
Emancipator - Outlaw
F1 theme song
For a more modern answer, Snowglobe by OWEL
Heat Above-Greta Van Fleet
Hmm
I absolutely adore the song Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley. I kinda want it as a song in my wedding somehow either walk down the isle or the first dance. My partner doesn’t like it, he thinks it sounds so sad and depressing and i just don’t hear it like that. Like yes it’s an emotional song but wouldn’t call it depressing
BFG-Division. SO beautiful
